He outlined how operationalizing carbon markets under Paris Agreement Article 6 can help reduce the costs of implementing nationally determined contributions (NDCs). He further underscored that the next round of NDCs should be informed by the outcome of the first Global Stocktake (GST), including with regard to transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just and orderly manner, taking into account national circumstances, pathways, and approaches. “COP 29 cannot and will not be silent on mitigation,” Babayev remarked, pointing to Action Agenda calls on energy grids and methane emissions from organic waste.

He noted the importance of measuring progress on adaptation and underscored that BTRs will help to avoid “making decisions in the dark.” "

Making their way through the venue, people milled about, discussing “how, not whether” the US election would affect climate cooperation. In a press conference, US President Biden’s Senior Advisor for International Climate Policy gave all the reassurances he could that a change of course in the country’s federal administration does not mean the private sector or local administrations will halt efforts toward clean energy expansion. “Very déjà-vu,” noted an observer who remembered the turmoil following Trump’s first election. “He is right that the fight against climate change is bigger than one political cycle,” noted an observer, “but this is the cycle that counts to keep 1.5°C in reach.”"

The dialogue was established within the finance section of the GST decision, but there is a debate about its scope. Is it about the provision of finance to implement the GST? Or, is it about tracking the implementation of the GST decision more generally? Delegates could not agree on this paragraph’s “origin story” and, therefore, could not find agreement on a way forward. The Presidency shuttled between bilateral meetings with coalitions and parties throughout the day, testing parties’ flexibility to support placing the dialogue under finance, with a footnote that this placement does not prejudice the scope of the dialogue."

The NCQG decision calls on all actors to work together to scale up financing to developing countries for climate action from all public and private sources to at least USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2035. It sets a goal of: at least USD 300 billion per year by 2035 for developing countries’ climate action from a wide variety of sources—public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources—and with developed countries taking the lead. Developing countries are encouraged to make contributions on a voluntary basis."

The Baku outcome pulled the carpet out from under this carefully constructed artifact. Developing countries who expected support for their climate action left Baku with far less than needed. The developed and developing countries who hoped everyone would undertake the much needed energy transition in lock-step left disappointed. The tatters are already showing for a rug so new.

These threads together make up the Paris Agreement. Interlocking motifs of the Agreement set out how countries will act, provide support, report, and take stock of their efforts. Since 2020, countries individually submitted their revised nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and collectively completed the first Global Stocktake (GST). Thus, each country knits its way, in a nationally determined manner, and contributes to creating a collective patchwork commensurate with the scale of the climate crisis. Or that’s the hope. In Baku, one of the last major pieces was due—a new collective quantified finance goal (NCQG) to support developing countries’ climate ambitions, including in their next NDCs."

Some were exasperated that a few parties held up progress. But, depending on which issue one looked at, and who was speaking, those “few” could be any range of countries. This brief analysis considers the package of decisions adopted—and not adopted—including the new finance goal, and on mitigation, carbon markets, adaptation, and gender. Baku exacerbated worries over the Paris Agreement’s ability to raise ambition and remain relevant in an increasingly frayed multilateral landscape."

Passed down from generation to generation, its pattern remains the same as when it was first woven, but it may be viewed differently. In Baku, countries looked at the Paris Agreement and, especially last year’s GST, and saw different stories. For some, the ratchet-up mechanism of the Agreement—that the GST should inform subsequently more ambitious NDCs—meant following up on the energy transition package agreed to in Dubai. For others, it meant focusing squarely on finance, crafting Baku’s legacy as the moment to raise promises of support to match developing countries’ needs. As countries looked to one another to move first on energy or finance, the two issues twisted together in an unfortunate downward spiral."

Back then, the number seemed to be plucked from the air. Delays in the delivery of the goal and the lack of clear accounting methodologies weakened trust; even in Baku, countries still debated whether or not developed countries crossed the 100 billion threshold. For the NCQG, countries held roundtables and reviewed expert reports that set the scale of need in the trillions. Despite the veneer of a practice-informed process, the Baku negotiations and outcome clarified what many knew: finance is deeply political. As such, many of the mistakes of 2009 were repeated."

Not only were China and the Gulf States (among others) uninterested, the US also re-elected Donald Trump, which could mean the US may again leave the Paris Agreement. Unlike in 2009, the EU largely stood alone in the final huddles and shouldered much of the ire as Cuba, India, Bolivia, Nigeria, and members of civil society called the final amount—USD 300 billion per year by 2035—an “insult” or “joke.”"

Over two years of discussions, developing countries were clear on how the global financial and investment system is failing them and climate action. The Standing Committee on Finance’s biennial look at climate finance flows confirms that most finance (from all sources, including domestic and international spending) flows to East Asia, Northern and Western Europe, and North America, in that order. Public and private climate finance neglects the most climate-vulnerable, and instead is pumped into larger, faster-growing economies. The least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) temporarily walked out of Presidency consultations because their minimum allocation floors, USD 220 and 39 billion respectively, were erased from the Presidency’s proposed text. In the multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy, two negotiators observed that “several developing countries wanted to protect their slice of the pie, especially if it wasn’t getting bigger.” This came at the expense of solidarity with those who have the highest capacity constraints and are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts."

Current NDCs will leave future generations with a 3°C warmer world. As UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell noted, this is better than where we were headed before the Paris Agreement, but it is far from a safe planet. New NDCs are due in February 2025. Many expect a few countries to meet this deadline and the rest to be announced closer to the Belém conference. Asking developing countries to strengthen the threads they have woven in the Paris Agreement in the form of more ambitious NDCs, with limited and unequally distributed support, will indeed require trust."
