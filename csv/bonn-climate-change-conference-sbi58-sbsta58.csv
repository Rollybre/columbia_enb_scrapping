Awaiting news from Heads of Delegation, negotiations on most issues however proceeded as usual, with delegates debating draft text and carefully crafting bridging proposals.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) invited parties’ views on elements for draft conclusions.
Several parties called for simple and concise draft conclusions that reflect the discussions and parties’ differing views on timing of authorization by host parties and the connection between the Article 6.4 registry and Article 6.2 international registry. One developing country emphasized reference be made to emissions avoidance and conservation enhancement activities.
Several parties proposed conducting joint intersessional work on authorization and the connection between the Article 6.4 registry and Article 6.2 registries, with some saying meetings should be conducted in a hybrid format to enhance participation.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare draft conclusions.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Matters relating to capacity building: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Catherine Goldberg (US), parties continued discussing the terms of reference (ToR) of the second review of the Paris Committee on Capacity Building (PCCB) and language on the role of the CMA therein.
On the ToR, parties converged on specifying the review will cover the progress of the PCCB and need for extension.
Parties converged on the COP reaffirming its decision to conduct the review, and inviting the CMA to participate in the review and affirm the COP decision on the matter. They agreed to discuss a draft CMA decision on the review in informal-informals.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Review of the progress, effectiveness, and performance of the Adaptation Committee: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Morgane Chiocchia (UK) invited parties’ views on draft conclusions. Parties suggested changes related to, among others:
the CMA’s participation in the review;
noting the limited engagement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Working Group II;
conducting activities related to locally-led adaptation; and
the provision of resources to support the Committee’s work.
Glasgow–Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Janine Felson (Belize) invited parties’ views on draft conclusions related to the development of the framework for guiding the achievement of the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and the review of overall progress in achieving it.
Some developed countries questioned the reference to the framework reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), as referred to in the Convention, noting the GGA falls under the Paris Agreement. Many developing countries urged retaining the reference to CBDR-RC.
Parties emphasized the text does not adequately capture their proposals, including on specific targets and indicators and cross-cutting considerations. They indicated their intention to submit proposals in writing and called for sufficient time for discussions on the GGA during SB 58.
Matters relating to the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement: Contact Group Co-Chairs Alison Campbell (UK) and Joseph Teo (Singapore) invited parties’ views on two informal notes: one containing elements for SB conclusions and another containing elements for the outline of a draft CMA decision on the Global Stocktake (GST). Many developing countries questioned the Co-Chairs’ mandate for preparing the notes. Most comments focused on the outline of the draft CMA decision.
Many developing countries preferred including: a preamble; context or vision; cross-cutting general assessment of progress; thematic areas including mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation, response measures, loss and damage; international cooperation; and the way forward from the first GST. Several developing countries, stressing the importance of “memory,” called for a section on pre-2020 ambition and implementation. Many did not support including “road maps.”
Many developed countries proposed aligning the outline with Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, which calls for taking stock of collective progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals and identifying actions for making progress. Several proposed having a streamlined outline with a few clear headings. Some suggested adding a section on guidance for nationally determined contributions (NDCs).
Parties mandated the Co-Chairs to revise the notes, emphasizing the need to reflect parties’ diverging views.
Sharm el-Sheikh joint work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Lucia Perugini (Italy) and Milagros Sandoval (Peru) invited parties’ views on draft conclusions.
Parties agreed on the need to support workshop attendance by developing countries, but some developed countries noted such matters better be addressed under relevant finance items.
Parties discussed the scope of an annual synthesis report to be prepared by the Secretariat, with some noting it could result in an “overwhelming amount of information.” The Secretariat invited parties to specify the due date for the annual report and emphasized limited capacity constrains the provision of an overview of activities by financial entities and other international and regional organizations.
On a paragraph related to the Sharm El-Sheikh online portal for sharing agriculture-related information, a developing country group stressed submissions should be made by national focal points and country-designated agriculture contacts. The group emphasized information should not be made without the relevant country’s input. One developing country raised concerns about website management, noting outdated information on infrequently updated UN websites.
Discussions will continue in informal-informals.
Sharm el-Sheikh mitigation ambition and implementation work programme: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand).
Several developing countries stated, given there is no agreement on the agenda, they did not agree with the consultations.
Several developed and developing countries suggested a CMA decision on this item could welcome the start of the work programme and the organization of the first global dialogue and investment-focused event. Several stressed the importance of clear framing for further events, with some calling for regional events, while others said all work programme events should be inclusive.
The Co-Facilitators noted there was no consensus on the way forward.  
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Second Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage: Participants reported on discussions held during the previous day’s breakout group session. They emphasized funding windows and triggers that ensure timely and effective support across all phases of loss and damage, from preparedness and immediate responses to events, to recovery and rehabilitation phases. At the same time, they noted these phases are interconnected and strong preparedness supports effective immediate responses and longer-term recovery efforts. Participants also discussed the unique funding challenges presented by non-economic losses, which are by their nature difficult to assign a cost to. Another area of broad agreement concerned the need for direct local access to funds, as well as to grant-based funding that does not increase debt.
In the subsequent discussion, the UN OFFICE FOR THE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS (UNOCHA) highlighted the importance of coordination to avoid “lost time and more work for overstretched aid workers.” The UN OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION (UNDRR) urged, among others, a layered approach to funding, with each layer supported by a specific funding instrument, and the right evidence base and data to quantify loss and damage. The SOLOMON ISLANDS called for the fund to respond to ocean-based loss and damage. ECUADOR stressed the fund should be standalone, rather than inserted into existing mechanisms. ETHIOPIA supported separate windows for rapid response, reconstruction, and slow-onset events, noting the need for flexibility in categorizing events.
Third meeting of the technical dialogue under the first Global Stocktake: Harald Winkler (South Africa) and Farhan Akthar (US) co-chaired the roundtable on integrated and holistic approaches.
Many developing countries discussed ways in which the global architecture is unjust and emphasized the need for policy space to achieve their national development goals. Speakers emphasized the importance of this discussion given the need to act systemically and to collectively move to a new paradigm.
Several speakers emphasized the need for climate-resilient development aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Some speakers called for ensuring human rights, public participation, and intergenerational equity in implementing the Paris Agreement, including the new NDCs. Linkages with biodiversity, water, and the ocean were highlighted.
Among other actions, speakers called for: phasing out fossil fuel subsidies; recognizing the implications of some taxation and trade policies for food security and development needs in other countries; and adopting whole-of-society approaches.
Executive Secretary meeting with observers: Executive Secretary Simon Stiell shared reflections on ongoing Secretariat-led work on strengthening observer engagement in the UNFCCC process, noting enhanced consideration of the needs of persons with disabilities in site design and pointing to capacity building for youth delegates. He highlighted measures aimed at addressing conflicts of interest, underscoring participant lists will now feature information on all badge types. He said participants will be asked to specify their organizational affiliation and opting-out thereof will be noted on the lists. Observers welcomed increased transparency as a valuable first step. They called for clear guidance on legitimate reasons for opting out, noting it should be limited to security considerations. Observers also called for having participants disclose their financial sponsorship, with exceptions for at-risk communities. Executive Secretary Stiell welcomed these remarks, noting ongoing discussions on sponsorship declarations.
Stakeholder consultations on the Sharm el-Sheikh dialogue on the scope of Article 2.1.c of the Paris Agreement (aligning finance flows) and its complementarity with Article 9 (climate finance): Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Facilitator of the dialogue in 2023, invited stakeholders’ perspective on the matter with a view to inform the organization of two workshops to be held in 2023.
Speakers emphasized the importance of redirecting finance flows while scaling up the provision of climate finance by developed countries. They pointed to developments such as: discussions on reforming multilateral development banks, the use of debt swaps, and the reallocation of special drawing rights; the UN Secretary-General’s initiative on net-zero accountability; and increasing investments in clean energy.
Other points related to, among others: the role of data to reduce uncertainty and foster investment in emerging markets; linkages to discussions on just transition; and hidden subsidies in the form of wealth capture by the Global North, women’s unpaid care work, and Indigenous Peoples’ stewardship in biodiversity conservation.
In the Corridors
Rumor has it, it is “global wellness day” somewhere in the outside world, noted a delegate prepared to spend a sunny Saturday indoors at the World Convention Center. “World weariness day, really…” quipped another, pointing to the perduring disagreement over the meeting’s agenda.
The day’s discussions underscored how strenuous the split is that delegates are maneuvering: in some rooms they are taking stock of collective progress in implementing the Paris Agreement; in others, especially those related to reviewing constituted bodies’ progress, it seems the Agreement is still fighting for its place.
“When you listen to these statements, do you ever lose the will to live?” sighed a seasoned observer, frustrated about the slow pace of the process amid incoming news of temperature and fire records. With many delegates out of steam, a walk along the Rhine during the Sunday break might be the wellness day everyone needs to turn things around."
1,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-daily-report-12jun2023,True,Daily report for 12 June 2023,"The 58th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) have yet to adopt their agendas. Parties brought their disagreements to the fore in plenary, but no compromise could be found. Although it remains unclear whether their outcome will be captured, negotiations continued throughout the day.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Organizational Matters: Adoption of the agenda: In an afternoon plenary, SBI Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan) invited parties to adopt the supplementary provisional agenda (FCCC/SBI/2023/1/Add.1), amending the title of item 8 to read work programme on just transition pathways referred to “in the relevant paragraphs of” decision 1/CMA.4.
Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, delineated the rationale for a proposed additional agenda item on urgently scaling up financial support from developed countries in line with Article 4.5 of the Paris Agreement to enable implementation for developing countries in this critical decade. Supported by Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, he emphasized the need for balance between discussions on ambition and means of implementation and underscored the “record of broken promises and failed commitments” by developed countries.
Agreeing that finance is critical, the EU, US, UK, CANADA, NORWAY and Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), opposed the LMDC’s proposal but indicated the mitigation work programme (MWP) provides space to discuss finance. Samoa, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), and Costa Rica, for the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), emphasized the importance of the MWP, with AOSIS underscoring it is a priority for the group, as it is key to staying below 1.5°C of warming.
The EU questioned the submission of a proposed agenda item after work was launched on the opening of the meeting and pointed to other finance-related processes already established in the climate negotiations. The US emphasized Article 4.5 of the Paris Agreement does not specifically refer to support by developed countries. The LMDCs highlighted the lack of a CMA mandate to address the MWP at SB 58, noting the matter was added to the agenda at the request of some parties after the publication of the provisional agenda, and underscored the need for negotiations rather than dialogues on scaling up finance.
The PHILIPPINES urged moving forward and adopting the agenda. Venezuela, for the BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA (ALBA), objected to the inclusion of the MWP, but expressed openness toward adopting the rest of the agenda. The EU, EIG, and AILAC opposed.
Parties could not reach agreement. The SB Chairs will continue consultations.
Matters relating to the least developed countries: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Jens Fugl (Denmark) invited parties’ views on draft conclusions. One developed country proposed adding a sub-paragraph on the submission and approval of proposals by least developed countries (LDCs) to the Green Climate Fund readiness programme for national adaptation plans (NAPs).
Parties converged on requesting the LDCs expert group (LEG) to continue assessing and to propose potential solutions for the challenges faced by many LDCs in relation to the formulation and implementation of NAPs, including by showcasing case studies of approaches, methodologies, and tools used to achieve particular adaptation outputs and outcomes.
Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings: The contact group, chaired by SBI Chair Munir, considered draft conclusions. Executive Secretary Stiell recalled that UNFCCC processes need to abide by the UN’s values.
On logistical arrangements that will facilitate inclusive and effective participation, Mexico, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, NORWAY, and other developed countries stressed the need to ensure sessions are safe for all and to specify that no reprisals should occur before, during, or after COP.
Both developed and developing countries supported ensuring greater participation from observer organizations from developing countries. NORWAY, the US, JAPAN, CANADA, MEXICO, and SWITZERLAND said they would not support quotas or limits on participation of observer organizations from developed countries to achieve greater parity. CHINA suggested making daily subsistence allowance (DSA) funding available for two civil society organizations on each developing country delegation. The Chair asked delegates to consult further on this issue.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Organizational Matters: Adoption of the agenda: In an afternoon plenary, SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands) noted lack of agreement on the agenda and indicated the SB Chairs will continue to consult thereon.
Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change: In informal consultations co-facilitated by María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Maria Samuelsen (Denmark), parties agreed on draft conclusions.
Research and systematic observation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Elizabeth Bush (Canada) and Ladislaus Chang’a (Tanzania) invited views on draft conclusions. Pointing to knowledge gaps, two developing country groups suggested removing reference to “best available science” and noting the importance of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in supporting decision making on climate change “as appropriate.” They also opposed reference to impacts increasing at every increment of global warming, noting this does not adequately capture discussions at the SBSTA-IPCC special event on the Sixth Assessment Synthesis Report.
Methodological issues under the Convention: Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Martin Cames (Germany) and Pacifica F. Achieng Ogola (Kenya), parties were unable to arrive at an agreement on language surrounding divergent views expressed on the reports from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO). Applying Rule 16 of the draft rules of procedure, the issue will be placed on the agenda for SBI 59.
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) invited parties’ views on an informal note. Developing countries underscored the need for rapid capacity building to empower them to contribute to the technical discussions on the development of the agreed electronic format (AEF). Parties agreed that a manual should be developed to assist with the preparation of the AEF. Many emphasized the importance of clarifying triggers for corresponding adjustments. Several developed countries noted persistent inconsistencies should be referred to the Paris Agreement Implementation and Compliance committee (PAICC) and the need for confidentiality should be justified with respect to national laws. A developing country group underscored the international registry could be a permanent option for many parties, not just an interim solution.
Discussions continued in the afternoon.
Rules, modalities, and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) invited parties’ views on an informal note. Comments related to, among others:
removing references to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) in a section on emission avoidance and conservation enhancement activities;
specifying the conditions under which revocation would be possible, with many parties underscoring the need to protect the credibility of the mechanism; and
ensuring the pulling and viewing of data not just from the Article 6.2 international registry, but also the national registries.
The Co-Facilitators will revise their informal note.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Glasgow–Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation: During informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) and Janine Felson (Belize) invited parties’ views on draft conclusions, including an annex with a revised list of elements for the development of the framework on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and an appendix containing possible targets for future workshop discussions on targets, indicators, and metrics.
Delegates lamented insufficient time to consider the document. Views diverged on the status of the annex and appendix. One developed country proposed to capture their content in an informal note and to specify, in the draft conclusions, that the informal note may inform further work.
Work programme on just transition pathways referred to in decision 1/CMA.4: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Selam Kidane-Abebe (Zambia) and Luisa Rölke (Germany) invited parties’ views on the revised informal note. Many parties called for streamlining the note, especially with regard to themes and linkages to existing workstreams.
Several developed countries underscored the work programme falls under the Paris Agreement, recalled the Agreement’s preambular language on just transition, and opposed references to principles of the Convention. One developed country underscored duplication with the agenda item on response measures, calling for the latter’s phase-out. Many developing countries highlighted the broader scope of just transition, noting it is not mitigation-centric.
A developing country group emphasized the work programme should address how the multilateral process will support nationally-determined just transition pathways. Several developed countries suggested the work programme identify available resources to support just transition pathways, both within and outside the UNFCCC.
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Technical Expert Dialogue under the Ad hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called for “bold and creative thought” to unlock the trillions needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
The World Resource Institute (WRI) highlighted current assessments of the quantum of finance needed differ in terms of time frames, sectors, and baselines. Global estimates of mitigation finance needed to reach net zero by 2050 range from cumulative USD105-275 trillion, they highlighted. Indicating that clean energy investments have increased, the International Energy Agency (IEA) emphasized progress is largely driven by leading economies, such as China, the EU, and the US. She highlighted the cost of capital as a major challenge for developing countries and underscored a new IEA-International Finance Corporation report showing public funds should at least triple to meet climate goals and must mobilize higher multiples of private finance.
During breakout group discussions, gaps in resources were discussed as one guide for setting the goal. Participants reflected on a bottom-up evaluation of the costs for implementing nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and national adaptation plans (NAPs) complementing a top-down scientific estimate of what is globally needed.
The importance of predictability and accountability, what the funding would be spent on, and who would be responsible for delivering the funding were discussed. Some noted contributions based on GDP might not be predictable, and inflation and the changing economic status of contributors and recipients should be accounted for. Private sector funding was also discussed as a component. Several groups call for a periodic review of the goal, with one group saying the goal should initially be adopted for the 2025-2030 period.
The ARAB GROUP proposed that the goal be USD 1.1 trillion per year in addition to the undelivered amounts from the USD100 billion goal.
Consultation on possible approaches for enhancing the recognition and accountability of non-party climate action: The Secretariat conducted a consultation on a draft implementation plan to follow up on Decision 1/CP.27, paragraph 65 and Decision 1/CMA.4 paragraph 93 inviting the Secretariat to ensure greater accountability of voluntary initiatives through the Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action platform.
The Secretariat reported that the platform, which was launched in 2014, aggregates information on disclosures and pledges, with records by 32,000 non-state actors to date. The information is not complete or well updated, however, with approximately 25% response rate to annual surveys about progress towards objectives. The Secretariat’s plan proposes to focus on net-zero commitments.
Several parties questioned whether the proposed actions were in line with the mandate and expressed doubt about whether the Secretariat could deliver them with the requested resources. Participants also asked about the relationship with the Race to Zero and the High-level Champions. Delegates were invited to submit their comments during the next two months.
In the Corridors
At the outset of the second week, the different strands of the process were as disconnected as ever. Those with a keen eye on the big picture welcomed the arrival of Greta Thunberg alongside fellow youth climate activists, and Peter Thomson, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, hoping this would bring a fresh injection of energy into the ossified meeting.
Negotiators meanwhile were knee-deep into their usual technical work. Delegates focused on cooperative approaches under the Paris Agreement and crammed in another six hours working on what a Co-Facilitator likened to Winnie The Pooh’s Heffalump, “a mythical creature that nobody has yet seen.”
Yet it was Heads of Delegation that delivered the “biggest showdown of them all.” During a plenary session in which SBI Chair Munir compared the debate to a bickering “primary school class,” statements on the proposed agenda items on mitigation and on finance volleyed back and forth, leading at least one observer to wish they “had brought their popcorn.”"
2,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-daily-report-13jun2023,True,Daily report for 13 June 2023,"With only two days remaining until the end of the 58th session of the Subsidiary Bodies, there is still no agreement in sight on the meeting’s agendas. Negotiations, however, continued largely undisturbed, including on the key issue of how to capture the outcome of the first Global Stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
National adaptation plans: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Antwi Boasiko (Ghana) and Jens Fugl (Denmark), parties continued discussing an informal note containing substantive elements of SBI conclusions. Parties requested changes related to, among others, adding references to science and Indigenous knowledge as providing guidance for developing national adaptation plans (NAPs).
Noting insufficient time to reach agreement on the substantive elements, parties converged on procedural conclusions, which specify consideration will continue at SB 59, including on the basis of the informal note from SBI 58.
Methodological issues under the Convention: Greenhouse gas data interface: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Thiago Mendes (Brazil) and Daniela Romano (Italy), parties were unable to agree on draft conclusions text concerning when to continue consideration of matters related to development of the GHG data interface, with options of SBSTA 60, 61, and 62 on the table. Some developing countries preferred SBSTA 62, citing data availability, while some developed countries considered that an unnecessary delay.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Reporting and review pursuant to Article 13 of the Paris Agreement: provision of financial and technical support to developing country parties for reporting and capacity-building: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Sandra Motshwanedi (South Africa) invited parties’ views on a revised informal note and suggested agreeing on short procedural conclusions that forward the note for further consideration at SB 59. Many parties questioned the use of brackets in the note, underscoring this is not the usual practice for a non-negotiated collection of views that has no formal status.
Several developing country groups called for inviting submissions on challenges faced by developing countries and proposals to address these. Several developed countries noted some of the proposed solutions listed in the note already exist. One developing country group emphasized this agenda item provides a space to evaluate support provided to developing countries to facilitate their participation in the Enhanced Transparency Framework, noting this goes beyond support by the Global Environment Facility and also encompasses other types of support, such as by the Secretariat.
The Co-Facilitators will consult with the SBI Chair on the way forward.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Glasgow–Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: During informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Janine Felson (Belize) invited parties’ views on three options for draft conclusions that differ with regard to how elements for the development of the framework are captured.
Many developing countries welcomed the first option, which features, as an annex, elements for the development of the framework. They called for the remaining workshop sessions to cover the development and use of targets, indicators, and metrics.
Several developed countries preferred the second option, which consists of procedural conclusions. They objected to the SBs taking note of the informal note and suggested inviting submissions on what to consider at the next workshops.
Matters relating to the Santiago network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Lucas di Pietro (Argentina). Reporting on discussions held in informal-informals, parties noted convergence on the structure and language of the draft COP and CMA decisions. Informal consultations will continue on the host recommendation.
Matters relating to the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement: Contact Group Co-Chairs Alison Campbell (UK) and Joseph Teo (Singapore) invited parties’ views on draft conclusions and a draft outline for the CMA 5 decision on the GST.
Most comments focused on the draft outline. Parties discussed whether to retain a section on “overarching messages,” with CHINA suggesting calling it “overarching information.”
CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, the US, and AUSTRALIA suggested moving a section on “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low-GHG emissions and climate-resilient development” above a section on means of implementation. Several developing countries, including CHINA, objected to the section on finance flows. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG) and others suggested combining the two sections.
CHINA objected to a section on “guidance,” but EIG and Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported the section.
The Co-Chairs encouraged delegates to discuss their views informally before the next meeting.
Work programme on just transition pathways referred to in decision 1/CMA.4: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Luisa Rölke (Germany) and Selam Kidane-Abebe (Zambia), parties continued exchanging views on a revised informal note, which many suggested could be streamlined. The Co-Facilitators also called for parties’ input on possible elements for draft conclusions.
Several developing countries emphasized just transition discussions are broader in scope than those on response measures. A developing country group opposed any reference to sources, noting the process’ focus on emissions and underscoring that developed countries do not live up to their own calls to phase out fossil fuels. Several developing countries emphasized the need to address poverty and reduce inequality within and between countries, noting this is the essence of just transition. Several parties called for inviting submissions ahead of CMA 5.
The Co-Facilitators will revise their informal note and prepare draft conclusions.
Sharm el-Sheikh joint work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Lucia Perugini (Italy) and Milagros Sandoval (Peru), a developing country group introduced a proposal for the establishment of the group to facilitate coordination of the joint work, including detailed provisions on its mandate and rules of procedure.
Parties agreed to discuss the proposal in informal-informals.
Sharm el-Sheikh mitigation ambition and implementation work programme: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand). Some developing countries noted there was no agreement to include this issue on the agenda and it was therefore not appropriate for the Co-Facilitators to prepare text.
Many developing and developed countries stressed the need to capture the group’s discussions, including guidance for the organization and topics to be discussed at the second and subsequent dialogues and investment-focused events.
The Co-Facilitators will consult the SB Co-Chairs on the way forward.
Stocktaking Plenary
SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands) and SBI Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan) reviewed progress on all items on which work was launched on 5 June and invited delegates to reflect on progress to date.
Switzerland, for the EIG, said the SBs should take a decision on the host for the Santiago Network and expressed concern with the slow progress of the GST and the lack of robust ideas for adaptation. Supported by the EU, he said harassment and bullying at UNFCCC meetings is unacceptable.
The EU highlighted progress on: the conclusion of the GST technical dialogue; the launch of the mitigation ambition and implementation work programme; progress on naming the host for the Santiago Network; technical dialogues on the new finance goal; and discussions on adaptation.
Samoa, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), lamented that “tactics are being used to slow progress.” She welcomed the draft outline for the CMA 5 decision on the GST, and expressed hope that the lack of an agenda would not jeopardize the work on mitigation and the host for the Santiago Network would be selected soon.
Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, noted the mitigation work programme was mandated by CMA 4, expressed appreciation for the work to build consensus on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), and said the outcome on agriculture should be in line with the SBs’ mandate.
Costa Rica, for the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), called for an adequate outcome on the GGA in Dubai and a clear decision on the host for the Santiago Network.
Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), said the GST needs to take into account pre-2020 implementation. He emphasized moving the round tables on the operationalization of non-market approaches forward and lamented that developed countries only wanted a procedural decision on the GGA.
Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, expressed hope there would be progress on NAPs and the GGA. Senegal, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), expressed concern with the progress on the GGA and encouraged others to resolve as many issues as possible at SB 58.
BRAZIL called on the SBs to signal, in this first UNFCCC meeting after the adoption of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report, that delegates are “hearing the science.”
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Ocean and climate change dialogue: In opening remarks, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, emphasized the need to regulate the carbon market, including with regard to nature-based solutions such as blue carbon. He underscored the importance of ocean science and cautioned on the risks of ocean-based carbon dioxide removal. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called upon participants to “blue the Paris Agreement” and exchange lessons learned to inform nationally determined contributions (NDCs), national adaptation plans (NAPs), and the GST.
Vladimir Ryabinin, Executive Secretary, INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC COMMISSION OF THE UN EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION (UNESCO-IOC), emphasized the need for more effective coordination within the UN on ocean issues and underscored addressing land-based pollution, fostering low-carbon maritime transport, and protecting blue carbon ecosystems. Tristan Tyrrell, CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (CBD), noted parties to the CBD are in the process of revising their National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) in light of the Global Biodiversity Framework adopted in 2022 and said this is an opportunity to enhance synergies with other processes, such as the UNFCCC. Tarub Bahri, UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO), emphasized the sustainable expansion and intensification of aquaculture in food as a solution to undernourishment and micronutrient deficiencies and highlighted the importance of renewable energy in small scale fisheries’ value chains.
Participants then engaged in breakout group discussions on coastal ecosystem restoration, including blue carbon, and fisheries and food security.
Sixth Technical Expert Dialogue under the Ad hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: Participants engaged in breakout group discussions, addressing sources of finance and the relation between the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) and Article 2.1.c of the Paris Agreement (aligning finance flows). Discussions related to, among others:
taking into account lessons learned from the USD100 billion goal, especially with regard to the mobilization of private finance;
accountability mechanisms for tracking work done by actors such as multilateral development banks and avoiding greenwashing by the private sector;
aligning finance flows not only with climate objectives, but also biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction; and
reducing harmful finance flows, as done in the context of the Global Biodiversity Framework.
As topics for future work, suggestions included: burden sharing arrangements between developed countries; barriers related to budgetary cycles in developed countries; and tracking the impacts of climate finance.
Participants emphasized the relevance of political guidance on: sources, timeframes, and the structure of the NCQG, and defining climate finance.
Third meeting of the technical dialogue under the first Global Stocktake: In the closing plenary, SBI Chair Munir stressed the GST is one of the most consequential events for the UNFCCC in 2023. SBSTA Chair Vreuls highlighted the innovative discussion formats used in the context of the technical dialogue and the online tool to harvest submitted information.
In closing remarks, Cuba, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed energy access, energy security, and food security need to be achieved in addition to the environmental goals. Switzerland, for the EIG, said equity issues should be captured in a multi-dimensional perspective. Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, said equity is the lens for the different pathways parties will follow to achieve the Paris Agreements’ goals. Trinidad and Tobago, for AOSIS, called for highlighting, inter alia, the need to address equity between countries, intergenerationally, and within countries, and the need to enhance international cooperation and cooperation between states and non-state-actors. Malawi, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), said the GST outcomes should inform the NCQG.
The EU supported including a technical annex in the outcome. Saudi Arabia, for LMDCs, and Algeria, for the ARAB GROUP, opposed an annex. The LMDCs also said opportunities for action and the need for political trust should be highlighted.
CHINA, supported by ENVIRONMENTAL NGOs (ENGOs), called for capturing the IPCC’s findings on the cumulative GHG emissions of developed countries. AUSTRALIA, supported by the US and JAPAN, said the report should not focus on historic responsibility. Business and Industry NGOs (BINGOs) called for NDCs to lay out a clear roadmap for the private sector. Indigenous Peoples Organizations (IPO) called for safeguarding the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Local Government and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) emphasized the role of local actors in achieving the Paris Agreement.
In the Corridors
“We were expecting more” admitted an earnest delegate, reflecting on plans for the process leading to a political outcome on the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. This echoed many delegates’ sentiments, not just on what some still hope will be the wake-up call spurring increased climate action, but also with regard to the climate process more generally.
The Subsidiary Bodies’ meetings in June have always been more of a stepping stone towards the big-ticket governing bodies’ meetings at the end of year, but this year “they are more akin to a stumbling block.” Neither discussions on mitigation nor on adaptation or finance are making much progress. And delegates working on fleshing out the just transition work programme “can’t even agree on its skeleton,” as one observer noted.
With only two days left to turn things around, delegates hoped that the most important agreements from this meeting would be more than the adoption of the agendas, while civil society kept up the pressure to expect more."
3,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-daily-report-14jun2023,True,Daily report for 14 June 2023,"The Subsidiary Bodies (SBs) finally adopted their agendas. A compromise was struck among Heads of Delegation: the mitigation ambition and implementation work programme will not feature on the agendas, but the SB Chairs will capture discussions held at the session in an informal note issued under their own authority. This agreement paved the way for the adoption of conclusions at SB 58.
Joint SB Plenary
In an evening plenary, the SBI and SBSTA adopted their respective agendas (FCCC/SBI/2023/1/Add.1 and FCCC/SBSTA/2023/1), with an amendment for the relevant agenda items to read “work programme on just transition pathways referred to in the relevant paragraphs of decision 1/CMA.4” and with the exception of the agenda items on the Sharm el-Sheikh mitigation ambition and implementation work programme (MWP), noting the understanding that work carried out on the MWP at SB 58 will be captured by the SB Chairs in an informal note issued under their own authority.
SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands) and SBI Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan) expressed appreciation for parties’ flexibility in reaching an agreement and allowing work to be launched prior to the adoption of the agendas. They noted this is not setting a precedent for future work.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Research and systematic observation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Elizabeth Bush (Canada) and Ladislaus Chang’a (Tanzania), parties discussed draft conclusions and draft COP and CMA decision text. With regard to the draft conclusions, some developing countries suggested adding references to equity and historical responsibilities in a sentence on the urgency for action in this decade.
With regard to the draft decision text, parties debated at length how to recognize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). Many developed and developing countries suggested recognizing that AR6 represents the most comprehensive and robust assessment of climate change to date, with an increased scope compared with previous assessment cycles providing integrated scientific, technical, and socio-economic information. Some developing countries called for recognizing that AR6 represents the latest assessment of climate change and expressing serious concerns regarding disputes among Panel members and the inclusiveness of its decision-making process.
Parties continued their consultations into the evening.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Second review of the functions of the Standing Committee on Finance: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Ali Waqas (Pakistan) and Gabriela Blatter (Switzerland) invited parties’ views on draft conclusions, pointing to carefully crafted bridging proposals based on consultations with groups and parties. Regarding disaggregated information on participation in sessions of the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), parties converged on referring to Annex I and non-Annex I parties, in line with language on the SCF’s composition. They also converged on the technical paper to be prepared by the Secretariat to consider, among others, “the extent to which” the SCF fulfilled its core functions and mandated activities.
With these amendments, parties agreed on the draft conclusions.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Review of the progress, effectiveness, and performance of the Adaptation Committee: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Maria Samuelsen (Denmark) and María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina), parties reflected on how to capture discussions held at SB 58. They converged on procedural draft conclusions and agreed to continue the consideration of the review on the basis of the draft decision elements contained in the informal note from SB 58.
Glasgow–Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Mattias Frumerie (Sweden), parties remained divergent with regard to whether and how to capture elements for the development of the framework on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). Many developing countries favored annexing a list of elements to the draft SB conclusions, welcoming further discussion over the elements at SB 58. Some developed countries underscored the list of elements is not a negotiated text and does not capture progress in the discussions.
Informal consultations continued into the evening.
Matters relating to the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement: Contact Group Co-Chairs Alison Campbell (UK) and Joseph Teo (Singapore) invited parties to comment on draft conclusions and an informal note containing a draft structure for the CMA 5 decision on the GST. The draft structure included five sections:
preamble;
context and cross-cutting considerations;
collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, in the light of equity and the best available science, and informing parties in updating and enhancing, in a nationally determined manner, action and support;
enhancing international cooperation for climate action; and
guidance and way forward.
Most of the discussion focused on the section on collective progress, which included five sub-sections: mitigation; adaptation; finance flows and means of implementation and support; efforts related to loss and damage; and efforts related to response measures.
Many parties indicated they would support the Co-Chairs’ draft without any changes, recognizing in particular that the sub-section on “finance flows and means of implementation and support” was finely balanced.
SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, and others proposed to refer to “means of implementation and support and finance flows,” instead of the other way around, or to delete the reference to “finance flows.”
The US insisted on retaining the reference to “finance flows” and suggested that “means of implementation and support” should be a sub-section under a heading “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.” NEW ZEALAND highlighted financial flows is a broader issue than means of implementation. CANADA and AUSTRALIA concurred.
After several proposals from the Co-Chairs and informal huddles to resolve whether and how to refer to “finance flows,” delegates reconvened for an evening session. Recognizing that delegates would not be able to agree on this sub-section at SB 58, the Co-Chairs suggested, and parties agreed, to include several options for the sub-section on finance flows and means of implementation.
On the draft conclusions, INDIA proposed deleting a paragraph welcoming the announcement of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Ambition Summit, which will take place in September 2023. SWITZERLAND supported retaining the text. Cuba, for the G-77/CHINA, said they would propose noting the Secretary-General’s appeal to reform the international architecture if this paragraph were retained. Delegates agreed to delete it.
Co-Chair Teo thanked delegates for their hard work and encouraged them to continue their constructive spirit as they complete the GST in the coming months.
Work programme on just transition pathways referred to in the relevant paragraphs of decision 1/CMA.4: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Selam Kidane-Abebe (Zambia) and Luisa Rölke (Germany), parties exchanged views on draft conclusions. On continued discussions at SB 59, many parties proposed these be “informed by” the informal note from SB 58, while some developed countries preferred saying the discussions “can be informed by” the note.
Parties debated who to invite to provide submissions, by when, and on what, and whose submission the Secretariat should capture in a synthesis report. Several developing country groups suggested inviting submissions on elements of the work programme, but not on activities and modalities, and preferred for the Secretariat to only synthesize submissions by parties. One developing country group questioned the reference to “non-party stakeholders” in addition to observers.
Parties also debated whether to hold an inter- or pre-sessional workshop prior to SB 59 and whether to request the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper.
Informal consultations continued in the evening.
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue: Co-Facilitators Niall O’Dea (Canada) and Julio Cordano (Chile) reported on the previous day’s breakout sessions, noting participants stressed building awareness of coastal ecosystem benefits, closing data and knowledge gaps, engaging with coastal communities, and de-risking investments.
During a panel on coastal ecosystem restoration, including blue carbon, participants pointed to mangrove and seagrass restoration projects and highlighted their inclusion in nationally determined contributions. They noted the need to adjust policy frameworks and develop innovative financial instruments, pointing to the creation of “blue bonds” to facilitate loans to small-scale fisheries and other projects within a blue economy frame. Discussions related to, among others, awareness raising among youth and adopting a gender-responsive, human rights-based approach to project development.
In a panel on fisheries and food security, participants highlighted examples of private sector finance and investment to enhance community resilience, including through aquaculture expansion. They also emphasized Indigenous Peoples’ traditional knowledge and solutions to local food security and fisheries stewardship. The ensuing discussion related to, among others: strategies for equitable investment and how to ensure projects are responding to the needs of women who rely on the Ocean for their livelihoods.
On what is needed to further centralize the role of the Ocean in climate change mitigation and adaptation through UNFCCC processes, including the Global Stocktake, some parties underscored the inclusion of ocean-based climate action and ocean science in countries’ NDCs and called for constituted bodies to integrate ocean action in their work plans.
In the Corridors
“Good to know this won’t all go to waste,” summed up a delegate as news of agreement on the Subsidiary Bodies’ agenda rippled across the World Conference Center around lunchtime on the penultimate day of the session. Some speculated this gave delegates just the push they needed to “fill their sails” and further clean up their texts as far as possible ahead of the closing plenary.
Considering this was their first substantive exchange over the matter, delegates working on the just transition work programme indicated they were quite pleased with progress made. Those working on the Global Goal on Adaptation and on research and systematic observation: much less so. With a panelist in the Ocean Dialogue promoting “eating clownfish” as an effective measure for addressing the rampant problems this invasive species causes around the globe, a frustrated observer suggested “eating other clowns” as she exited heated discussions on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary and analysis of the 2023 Bonn Climate Change Conference will be available on Monday, 19 June 2023"
4,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-daily-report-5jun2023,True,Daily report for 5 June 2023,"The Bonn Climate Change Conference started with a familiar hiccup: an agenda fight. Despite many hours of consultations among Heads of Delegation prior to the opening of the Conference, no agreement had been reached and the start of the Subsidiary Bodies’ joint opening plenary was delayed into the afternoon. Ultimately, parties agreed to launch work based on the provisional agendas, with the understanding that consultations will continue and the agendas will be adopted at a later stage.
Opening Statements
Executive Secretary Simon Stiell encouraged parties to “be brave” and prioritize the common good, noting that this also serves national interests. He said discussions on mitigation are key to unlock innovation, which must be used to revise and strengthen nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies. He highlighted that a strong agreement on just transition can enable action, build trust, and drive transformative development.
Sweden, for the EUROPEAN UNION, called for enhanced and immediate transformation of all sectors to reach net zero by 2050. He expressed optimism that developed countries will meet the USD100 billion climate finance commitment in 2023.
Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, urged to keep a clear focus on 1.5°C ahead of COP 28 and called for all greenhouse gases to be included in NDCs, which should also reflect parties’ ambitions to reduce and peak emissions by 2025. They also welcomed the United Kingdom to the Group.
Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), highlighted that “we are on the brink of missing out on 1.5°C,” and reminded participants the upcoming Global Stocktake (GST) is the only iteration providing a chance to avoid an overshoot and adopt a full range of decisions to this end. He called for a mosaic approach to loss and damage funding and reiterated the importance of non-party stakeholder involvement.
Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, said discussions on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) should conclude with a decision that advances the resilience of developing countries. He also stressed: NAPs should be a standing item on the SBI agenda; COP 28 is the “GST COP” and the outcome should help countries implement their NDCs; and a trust fund and work program on just transition should be adopted at COP 28.
Samoa, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), emphasized the need to ratchet up ambition through the outcome of COP 28 on the GST, MWP, and GGA, and the need to operationalize fit-for-purpose funding for loss and damage, focusing on particularly vulnerable countries.
Senegal, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), underscored that funding is not keeping pace with the growing need for building adaptation capacities in the face of increasingly extreme climate events. He lamented that loss and damage is being sidelined in the GST discussion and progress on gender equality has been slow.
Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, said negotiations must be inclusive, transparent, and guided by the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. He stressed the importance of balanced texts and reiterated that “our people are suffering from a climate crisis which they have not contributed to.” He noted some countries are “playing to the gallery” but not fulfilling pledges.
Costa Rica, for the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), said the GST is a chance for multilateralism to build a global response to the “pivotal challenge” of climate change and called on the SBs to develop a decision-making roadmap thereon. She called for COP 28 to agree on a fund on loss and damage and stressed the need to step up efforts to eliminate fossil fuels with clear dates.
Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, called for balanced work, emphasizing the importance of attention to adaptation, and urged that discussions should not deviate too much from the achievements of COP 27. She reiterated the importance of financial and technological support for developing countries to address climate change and eradicate poverty.
Papua New Guinea, for the COALITION OF RAINFOREST NATIONS, urged for the findings of the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report to feed into the SBs’ work. She highlighted that addressing land-use change poses the most promising and immediate opportunity to achieve reductions in emissions.
South Africa, for SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, and CHINA (BASIC), noted the importance of the GST in identifying gaps and spurring an enhanced global response. He called for more finance to support developing countries’ climate action.
Uruguay, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, and URUGUAY (ABU), called for concrete results from the technical dialogue of the GST and a clear mandate on targets and indicators to achieve the GGA.
Venezuela, for the BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA (ALBA), stressed that loss and damage funding must be predictable, adequate, and stem mainly from public funds. She urged a climate justice, rights-based approach to just transition and emphasized the need for non-market based approaches to strengthen implementation, while avoiding “unilateral coercive” measures that restrict development.
The INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) highlighted the robust scientific knowledge contained within the reports of the sixth assessment cycle.
The WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO) stated there is a 66% chance the world will temporarily exceed 1.5°C due to the effects of El Niño.
The INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION (IMO) highlighted maritime transport’s indispensable role in global trade and highlighted their efforts to develop measures and solutions to the industry’s contribution to air pollution and climate change, and support island states and developing countries.
WOMEN AND GENDER, emphasizing that there is “no climate justice without gender rights,” highlighted the need to support care work and social protection and called on parties to “ensure a full, fair fossil fuel phaseout.”
YOUTH NGOs (YOUNGO) underscored that, inter alia: visa issues have reduced youth participation in the SBs; delayed action is shifting the burden to frontline communities and future generations; climate finance goals must “get out of the UNFCCC silo”; and the IPCC must be shielded from the influence of polluters.
Business and Industry NGOs (BINGO) called for scaling up mitigation ambition, leaving Bonn with a “robust text” on Article 6, and setting an ambitious goal that would “supercharge” climate finance.
Environmental NGOs (ENGO) stressed that a “legitimate COP is a fossil fuel-free COP” and called for rapid, real emission cuts based on the principles of justice and equity, rather than relying on mechanisms such as carbon markets and geoengineering.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES called for: real emissions reductions at the source and rapidly phasing out fossil fuels rather than carbon offsets; prioritizing prevention in loss and damage mechanisms; and not combining their group with local communities.
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES (LGMAs) called attention to a local community that has conducted its own equivalent of a global stocktaking process.
RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (RINGOs) stressed the need for the GST to follow a science-led approach and include science that is generated in the Global South.
TRADE UNION NGOs (TUNGOs) called for including stakeholders in discussions to ensure there is a just transition, and clear and ambitious conclusions from the GST, including for a structured exit from fossil fuels.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
In opening remarks, SBI Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan) recalled that climate change already impacts millions of people every day, underscoring “they cannot wait for agendas to be adopted and for leaders to agree on declarations.” He urged all parties to ramp up ambition, in accordance with the principles of the Convention and the Paris Agreement.
Organizational Matters: Adoption of the agenda: Chair Munir pointed to consultations with groups and parties on the agenda, both ahead of the meeting and throughout the morning. He noted there is no agreement, but parties converged on launching work on the basis of the supplementary provisional agenda (FCCC/SBI/2023/1/Add.1) with the understanding that consultations will continue and the agenda will be adopted at a later stage.
Organization of work: A contact group will convene on budgetary matters.
Informal consultations will convene on:
Reporting from non-Annex I parties: Provision of financial and technical support;
Reporting and review pursuant to Article 13 of the Paris Agreement: provision of financial and technical support to developing country parties for reporting and capacity-building;
Trust Fund for the Clean Development Mechanism;
Matters relating to LDCs;
Linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism of the Convention;
Second review of the functions of the Standing Committee on Finance;
Matters relating to capacity-building; and
National adaptation plans.
Matters relating to the Adaptation Fund was deferred to SBI 59.
The SBI Chair will conduct consultations on the following items:
Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings;
Reporting from and review of Annex I parties; and
Reporting from non-Annex I parties.
BRAZIL stressed the need for information from the consultations on Annex I reporting and review for the GST.
The US stressed the importance of the summary reports on the technical analysis of biennial update reports of non-Annex I parties for the GST.
BRAZIL said the consultations on Annex I and non-Annex I reporting should be separate consultations. The SBI agreed.
Matters relating to the least developed countries: During the opening plenary, the LDC Expert Group (LEG) reported on its work (FCCC/SBI/2023/7) and encouraged LDCs to make use of the 41 rostered experts.
Administrative, financial and institutional matters: In plenary, on budgetary matters, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell highlighted that three budget scenarios have been presented: 0% nominal growth, which would result in a reduction of the Secretariat’s budget in real terms; actual needs, which is based on existing mandates and would result in a doubling of the budget; and a proposed budget, which would result in 16% net growth. Stiell said reliance on supplementary funds results in unpredictable and insufficient funding for the Secretariat. He also called attention to the fact that parties are in arrears by EUR30 million.
SWITZERLAND said the level of arrears is unacceptable. Stressing the need for transparency on this issue, he requested a list of countries who have been in arrears for over two years.
On the continuous review of the functions and operations of the secretariat, UNFCCC Senior Director Chhaya Kapilashrami delineated actions taken upon the recommendation of the board of auditors, including new delegation of authority, and a review of ICT controls and synergies to be established among existing tools. Parties agreed to this proposal.
On Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, Kapilashrami thanked the German government and city of Bonn for their support and pointed to the issue of visa issuance for participants hoping to attend the SBs, with GERMANY noting it is working with its embassies to address these issues. Delegates agreed to further consider the issue at future SBI sessions.
On the UNFCCC annual report, parties took note of the report (FCCC/SBI/2023/9).
Reporting and review pursuant to Article 13 of the Paris Agreement: Provision of financial and technical support to developing country Parties for reporting and capacity-building: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Sandra Motshwanedi (South Africa) recalled the SBI decided to continue consideration of this matter at SBI 58 with a view to recommending a draft decision for consideration and adoption by CMA 5. She pointed to submissions received intersessionally and invited parties’ views. One developing country group pointed to restrictions to the allocation of financial support, noting these foster the commissioning of external consultants rather than in-country capacity building. Another developing country group called for a rolling approach to avoid interruptions between individual support cycles. Parties also discussed the importance of building capacity to use the new reporting tool, with several developed countries noting this is not specific to developing countries and one developed country expressing concerns that the tool’s development is lagging due to budgetary constraints. Parties mandated the Co-Facilitators to prepare an informal note, with one developing country group underscoring parties generally agree on what the challenges are but diverge on what solutions to opt for.
Reporting from non-Annex I parties: Provision of financial and technical support: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Eve Deakin (UK). Noting commonalities with the agenda item on the provision of support for developing country reporting under the Paris Agreement (SBI agenda item 5), parties suggested cross-references or mirroring text, where appropriate. One developing country group noted discussions should inform the negotiations on the provision of guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings: In a contact group session, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as the incoming COP 28 Presidency, briefed delegates about preparations for the Dubai Climate Change Conference. In response to an inquiry from Bhutan, for the LDCs, on concerns about accommodation costs, the UAE indicated it has launched an accommodation portal and is setting hotel prices to avoid price surges. She said 140,000 rooms are available in Dubai. Delegates also discussed potential locations for future COPs, including COP 30 hosted by Brazil in the Amazon. Both Australia and Türkiye indicated they may bid to host COP 31. Slovenia confirmed the Eastern European group will hold deliberations during SB 58 on the host for COP 29.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands) opened the meeting on Monday, 6 June 2023.
Organizational Matters: Adoption of the agenda: Pointing to the approach agreed to under the SBI, Chair Vreuls noted parties agreed to launch work on the basis of the provisional agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/1) and conduct further consultations with a view to adopting the agenda.
Organization of work: A contact group will convene on the work programme under the framework for non-market approaches referred to in Article 6.8 of the Paris Agreement.
Informal consultations will convene on:
Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change;
Research and systematic observation;
Methodological issues under the Convention: Greenhouse gas data interface;
Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport;
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2, of the Paris Agreement; and
Rules, modalities, and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement.
Joint SB contact groups will convene on:
Matters relating to the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement; and
Matters relating to the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures.
Joint informal consultations will convene on:
Glasgow–Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation;
Matters relating to the Santiago network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts;
Work programme on just transition pathways referred to in decision 1/CMA.4, paragraphs 50–52;
Sharm el-Sheikh joint work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security; and
Sharm el-Sheikh mitigation ambition and implementation work programme.
Cooperation with other international organizations: The SBSTA took note of the report (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/INF.1). SBSTA Chair Vreuls will consult parties on preparing draft conclusions.
Annual report on the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories of Annex I parties: The SBSTA took note of the reports (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/INF.3, FCCC/SBSTA/2021/INF.4, and FCCC/SBSTA/2020/INF.3).
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia), discussions focused on parties’ feedback on, among others, outcomes of an intersessional workshop on the agreed electronic format (AEF) for annual information, and preparation of the reporting on elements to be listed in the initial report.
Several parties called for prioritizing completion of the AEF and addressing the inconsistencies between the national and international registries for recording and tracking under the mechanism. Others proposed drafting a manual on the AEF as well as on biennial transparency report (BTR) tables, to improve understanding of the process. Several parties highlighted the effectiveness of the intersessional workshops and suggested that more workshops be planned in the future, particularly on testing the draft version of the AEF and operationalizing the Article 6 database. Others noted challenges related to virtual workshops.
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
SBSTA–IPCC special event on the findings in the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC: IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee stressed that the present pace and scale of climate action are insufficient, with much deeper cuts in emissions necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. IPCC authors underscored that the Sixth Assessment Report emphasizes, inter alia: half the world’s population–3.3 to 3.6 billion people–live in contexts highly vulnerable to climate change; many people, such as farmers in low-lying coastal areas, are experiencing soft limits to adaptation; and without deeper mitigation, warming is likely to reach 1.5°C in the near term. During question and answer sessions, IPCC authors stressed unequivocal evidence that human activities are fueling climate change, which has reached 1.1°C over 1850-1900 levels.
In the Corridors
Heads of delegation quickly rolled up their sleeves once they arrived in Bonn: without time to settle in, they jumped right into debates over the meeting agendas. But neither the Sunday evening talks nor the continued consultations throughout Monday morning brought agreement. A seasoned delegate even shared that the list of issues over which parties disagree had grown. “That’s what you get when you catapult something into the cover decisions without much discussion,” noted one of her colleagues, pointing to the just transition work programme established at COP 27.
The threat of an agenda fight spilling into plenary had delegates split. Some hoped to draw parties out from under their covers: “let those opposing negotiations on the mitigation work programme say so publicly.” Others applauded the workaround reached through informal channels to open work in the Subsidiary Bodies while continuing the agenda discussion on the side, which allowed the conference to get underway, albeit several hours after the original starting point."
5,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-daily-report-6jun2023,True,Daily report for 6 June 2023,"The second day of the Bonn Climate Conference was as inconspicuous as the first one was tense: debates over the meeting agendas were largely confined to the level of Heads of Delegation, leaving technical negotiations to take their usual course.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (NWP): During informal consultations co-facilitated by María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Maria Samuelsen (Denmark), parties reflected on progress under the NWP (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/2). They suggested: work on risk management related to agriculture and food security; enhancing partnerships with universities, especially in the Global South; and more tailored support, especially in terms of language. Several parties called for exploring further cross-cutting work and synergies, such as with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). There were requests for clarification on a few elements of the progress report, including on new activities for the NWP. Some parties called for working on draft conclusion text during the next informal consultations.
Research and systematic observation: In an informal consultation co-facilitated by Elizabeth Bush (Canada) and Ladislaus Chang’a (Tanzania), many parties lamented the lack of a separate agenda item to consider the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report. They nevertheless mandated the Co-Facilitators to draft COP and CMA decision texts on the conclusion of the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Cycle (AR6), and SBSTA conclusions on research and systematic observation, leaving room for outcomes from the 15th meeting of the research dialogue to be held on 8 June 2023.
Parties congratulated the IPCC on the completion of its Sixth Assessment Cycle and noted the “clear messages” and “new insights” it provided. They also identified research gaps and underscored elements of the report for inclusion in the COP and CMA draft decision texts, including:
the need for better integration of findings between IPCC Working Groups in synthesis reports;
more balanced representation of authors between the Global North and Global South;
lack of funding, which contributes to adaptation gaps;
synergies and tradeoffs between climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals;
the importance of ensuring that climate policies are consistent with national circumstances; and
findings on emission metrics.
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia). A few parties pointed out the need to clarify the required information, activity types, affected sectors, and stage of authorization before submission of the agreed electronic format (AEF), with one country proposing the creation of a separate table for authorization.
On the sequencing and timing of initial reports, several parties agreed that review of the initial report is crucial to understanding how parties use the mechanism to achieve their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), but pointed out that the sequencing and timing of submission of initial reports were already agreed upon at CMA 4.
On inconsistencies in the information provided, several parties considered that, while inconsistencies should be reported, parties must be allowed sufficient time to address and correct them. In case of non-responsiveness, some parties advised that this could be considered an inconsistency and be raised as an issue.
On confidentiality, several parties emphasized the need for transparency but pointed out that CMA 3 already specified what information parties can designate as confidential.
Rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement: In informal consultations facilitated by Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan), discussions focused on parties’ feedback on the inclusion of emission avoidance and conservation enhancement activities in Article 6.4 and the timing of authorization by host countries.
Several parties opposed the inclusion of emission avoidance, with some pointing out that avoidance would be merely hypothetical, particularly when it involves the forestry sector. A few parties noted inclusion of emission avoidance would create another track of work for the CMA and called for more guidance and clarification on the activities currently included in the provision.
On the matter of timing of authorization by host countries, several parties stressed that authorization must be given as early as possible in the process, noting this helps with project financing and reduces uncertainty for stakeholders, especially for those in the private sector. Others emphasized authorization is a national prerogative and should be left to the discretion of the host countries to ensure cooperative approaches do not compromise their NDCs.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Matters relating to the least developed countries (LDCs): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Jens Fugl (Denmark) invited parties to share views on the LDC Expert Group’s (LEG) report on its work (FCCC/SBI/2023/7). One party expressed reservation over the fact that 11 countries have yet to begin the process of developing their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), with another requesting an expansion of the LEG’s mandate to not only identify gaps but also develop and propose solutions to the challenges identified.
Alongside expressions of support and appreciation for the LEG, parties looked forward to considering a draft text during the next informal consultation.
Administrative, financial, and institutional matters: Co-Chairs Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Georg Børsting (Norway) informed parties that the contact group will discuss: the 2024-2025 budget, contributions, efficiency, and transparency for the budget process.
UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell highlighted that the next two years are exceptionally important for achieving the Paris Agreement’s objectives, which he said justifies a budget increase. He indicated the increase in the budget proposal reflects the growing number of COP mandates: whereas COP 25 resulted in seven major mandates, COPs 26 and 27 resulted in 60 major mandates. Of the three budget scenarios, Stiell noted that while the “realistic” scenario represents a 42% increase over the last biennium, it is a 16% increase in real terms. He called attention to the risks involved with heavy reliance on supplemental funding.
The UN Board of Auditors Office briefed parties on their audit cycle, which included a focus on risk management during 2022. He said four main audit findings related to: reputational risks linked to the conclusion of partnerships and selection of contributors; legal risks; resource risks; and problematic accounting in the context of the growing complexity of climate finance.
Parties raised questions about whether UN salaries should always rise with inflation, the risks from earmarks and arrears, and what the Secretariat has done to ensure due diligence on the selection of partners.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Review of the progress, effectiveness and performance of the Adaptation Committee: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Morgane Chiocchia (UK), parties noted the Adaptation Committee generally performed well and highlighted areas for continued focus or improvement. Suggestions related to, among others:
outreach and information sharing;
collaboration with other bodies, including partners beyond UNFCCC;
locally-led adaptation; and
virtual meeting formats that allow for enhanced participation and transparency.
Several developing countries called for achieving balanced and equal representation from the Global South among technical experts and for developed countries to provide sufficient resources. Some proposed extending the focus of the committee’s work to support the Global Stocktake (GST). Many emphasized the need to maintain a flexible work plan, especially to respond to potential mandates coming out of the Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh work programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA).
The Co-Facilitators will produce a draft text for consideration during the next informal consultations.
Matters relating to the Santiago Network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts: In informal consultations co-facilitated by SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands) and SBI Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan), parties engaged with the two potential hosts of the Santiago Network’s secretariat (FCCC/SB/2023/1).
Responding to some parties’ concerns, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) pointed to existing Memoranda of Understanding with their proposed partners to ensure sufficient global reach. Discussions also related to, among others, how the CDB would use its position as a development bank to leverage more funding for the network and on how quickly it could launch the secretariat.
Regarding the consortium between the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), some parties sought clarification on the provision of technical support and expertise on loss and damage, which goes beyond the organizations’ scope of work and mandate. Other questions related to, among others: coordination with local communities; the mobilization of in-kind contributions; and having a “lean” secretariat.
Both potential hosts were asked to clarify: their anticipated relationship with the Network’s secretariat; anticipated administrative costs; general procurement procedures; and how they intended to ensure most of the funding for the secretariat would go to technical assistance and capacity building.
Discussions with the potential hosts will continue informally.
Work programme on just transition pathways: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Selam Abebe (Zambia) and Marianne Karlsen (Norway) said whether the outcome of discussions on contentious items, such as the just transition work programme, will be captured depends on the pending agreement on the agendas. Recalling the mandate to prepare a draft decision for consideration by CMA 5 that fleshes out the work programme, they invited parties’ views on its: objective, scope, institutional arrangements, modalities, linkages, and inputs and outcomes. Several developing country groups called for going beyond knowledge sharing and emphasized means of implementation.
On the scope, many developed countries pointed to the Paris Agreement’s preamble, emphasizing workforce training. Developing countries called for a broader scope ensuring sustainable development, with some emphasizing green technology transfer.
On the timeline of the work programme, suggestions included a one-, two-, or three-year mandate. Many emphasized feeding into the second GST.
On outcomes, some called for annual decisions while others preferred summary reports to be prepared either by the SB Chairs or the Secretariat. References were also made to, among others: fossil fuel subsidy reforms, intergenerational equity, and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).
The Co-Facilitators invited further submissions in writing.
Matters relating to the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures serving the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement: Catherine Goldberg (US) and Peter Govindasamy (Singapore) co-chaired contact group discussions.
Saudi Arabia, for the G-77/CHINA, called for allocating more time for discussions on the mid-term review of the forum, while the US, UK, EU, and others called for concluding it and moving to discussing guiding questions for the review of the functions, work programme, and modalities of the forum.
On guiding questions for the review, parties converged on mandating the Co-Chairs to produce a draft text that incorporates both questions listed in the Secretariat’s summary report on views and guiding questions (FCCC/SB/2023/2) as well as further questions raised by parties during the contact group discussions.
Additional questions included: whether the forum has addressed the negative impacts of climate policies in an inclusive and holistic manner; and how the impacts of climate policies compare to the impacts of climate change. GHANA asked whether there should be new and/or more modalities.
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Third meeting of the technical dialogue under the global stocktake: In opening remarks, Co-Chairs Harald Winkler (South Africa) and Farhan Akthar (US) recalled that the GST is the first opportunity to take stock of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s objectives. They said over 170,000 pages of information have been uploaded to the GST information portal, and options for examining this data using artificial intelligence are being explored.
UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell said the GST process would be “legacy making” and its outputs would frame decisions at COP 28 and beyond.
Negotiating groups highlighted priorities for the GST outcomes. The EU and Trinidad and Tobago, for AOSIS, and others supported the identification of best practices, including through a “menu of options” or an annex. Saudi Arabia, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDC), cautioned that it would be difficult to make such an annex “non-policy prescriptive.”
LMDCs said the GST must signal: finance from developed countries needs to be adequate and predictable; technology development and transfer is lacking but important; and capacity building is essential. Cuba for the G-77/CHINA said there should be balanced treatment across all issues, not only mitigation. LMDCs and Algeria, for the ARAB GROUP, called for a focus on the pre-2020 ambition gap.
Other points related to, among others: common methodologies for reporting on loss and damage; identifying synergies across sectors; and the role of the GST in informing parties’ next NDCs and the GGA discussions. In the afternoon, discussions continued in a world café format.
Second biennial in-session workshop on information to be provided by parties in accordance with Article 9.5 of the Paris Agreement: This workshop provided room for parties to reflect on lessons learned with regard to ex-ante climate finance information. The Secretariat presented a compilation and synthesis of the second biennial communications (BCs). Developed countries shared their experience in preparing their second BCs, noting lessons learned from reading other parties’ reports and hearing how developing countries use these.
On topics for the high-level ministerial dialogue on climate finance to take place at COP 28, parties highlighted, among others: identifying barriers and potential reforms to budgetary systems; linkages to the objective of aligning financial flows towards to the goals of the Paris Agreement; doubling adaptation finance; loss and damage funding; and funding instruments. Parties called for interactive discussions between ministers.
In the Corridors
“Today was actually quite civil,” summed up a seasoned delegate. Despite the pending disagreement on the meeting agendas, negotiations on the just transition work programme started smoothly and negotiators are already calling for draft text on a range of agenda items.
The technical dialogue under the Paris Agreement’s first Global Stocktake lived up to its reputation as a testing ground for innovative session formats. With the “world café” setting now well established, delegates were asked to role play and put themselves in the shoes of actors ranging from local farmers to the head of a multilateral development bank. Not all were convinced of the exercise’s conduciveness.
A stocktaking of a different kind was taking place in discussions involving budgetary challenges. The Secretariat implored parties for funding to ensure the successful and timely development of the tools for reporting under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework. Pointing to the 60 major mandates added during COP 26 and COP 27, the Co-Chair of the budget consultations recalled that “Parties decide. And, at the end of the day, they suffer the consequences of what they decide,” leaving participants pondering the implications for climate ambition."
6,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-daily-report-7jun2023,True,Daily report for 7 June 2023,"While agreement on the Subsidiary Bodies’ agendas remains as elusive as ever, informal consultations continued on a range of issues. In some cases, such as discussions related to research, delegates engaged in concrete text-based negotiations.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Maria Samuelsen (Denmark) sought views on draft text, which received general support. Many parties called for more specific language on regional activities and on making outputs available in the five UN languages. Several parties said the paragraphs on budgetary matters should be consolidated and refined. Parties indicated they will submit concrete proposals to inform the next iteration of draft text.
Research and systematic observation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Elizabeth Bush (Canada) and Ladislaus Chang’a (Tanzania) invited parties’ views on draft text. Suggestions related to, among others:
adding language on an in-session technical workshop by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on emission metrics contained in the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6);
expressing appreciation for the work done by AR6 authors; and
balancing the text between pointing to research gaps and underscoring the progress on scientific understanding achieved since AR5.
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) sought feedback on the international registry, including its interoperability with national registries, functionality and procedures, and guidance on internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs).
Recalling that parties can either develop their own national registries or rely on the international registry, several parties underscored the need to link national registries to the international one to allow for a global tracking system of ITMOs. Some noted this was already agreed upon at CMA 3. A few parties, however, opposed the linkage, stating that management of national registries should be a national prerogative.
Several parties raised concerns about the ability of the international registry to perform all the functions that will enable parties to report cooperative approaches properly and accurately, with a few parties highlighting the need for a simple yet functional and reliable international registry. Others suggested the conduct of capacity building and more guidance on ITMOs to better understand the information being tracked by the registry.
Rules, modalities, and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan).
On the issue of authorization, several parties emphasized it should be given by host parties as early as possible to give the right market signals for investors and prevent market uncertainties. One developing country reiterated authorization should be left at the host party’s discretion, while a developed country stated it should be allowed any time after issuance, but before validation.
Several parties underscored the importance of connecting the Article 6.4 registry and the Article 6.2 international registry to ensure information on Article 6.4 emissions reductions is centralized. They noted this would allow for the automated pulling and viewing of information and help parties streamline their reporting. Others struggled to understand how to operationalize the Article 6.4 registry.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings: In a contact group chaired by SBI Chair Nabeel Munir, parties emphasized the need to address issues such as visa delivery, hotel prices, waiting times to enter the venue, meeting room capacity, and modalities for active virtual participation.
On streamlining agendas, suggestions related to thematic clustering, the use of headlines, and the phasing out or temporary “pausing” of items. The EU suggested inviting the Secretariat to provide information on the organizational implications of mandated events and intersessional work.
On observer engagement, comments related to the lack of balance between the number of observers from developed and developing countries, underscoring the need to support further inclusion of the latter, as well as to reflect on different actors’ rationales for engaging in the process. Mexico suggested changing the speaking order for plenary statements, with observers speaking after groups, followed by individual countries.
Administrative, financial and institutional matters: Co-Chairs Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Georg Børsting (Norway) informed the contact group of the objective for the SBs to forward a draft decision on the matter for consideration and adoption by COP 28 to ensure contributions are not delayed for the coming year.
Parties asked the Secretariat to prepare a 0% real growth budget scenario, in addition to its 0% nominal growth, 16% real growth, and “full cost” budget scenarios.
Several parties asked why some activities were proposed to be funded through supplementary funds rather than core funds and vice versa. One party said the development of tools for reporting under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework is key and should not be funded through supplemental sources. Several parties noted core funds should not be used for engagement with non-party stakeholders or implementation of recommendations from bodies other than the parties. Some parties stressed the need for balance, with one noting mitigation-related activities have been assigned one-third more funding than adaptation.
Parties raised the need to reduce arrears and were informed 23 countries have not paid for more than ten years. A developed country suggested adopting a decision on how future budgets would be developed.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Matters relating to the Santiago Network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts: The informal consultation, co-facilitated by Lucas di Pietro (Argentina) and Cornelia Jäger (Austria), saw most parties expressing a mix of appreciation and concern on the two potential hosts of the Santiago Network’s secretariat. Concerns from most parties related to: having only two candidates to choose from; the independence of the secretariat from its host; a lack of clarity on financing and budgetary matters; and the objective to make a clear recommendation on a host at SB 58 to ensure the timely operationalization of the Network. Several countries expressed their desire to continue engaging with the potential hosts to clarify remaining questions.
Matters relating to the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement: Contact group Co-Chairs Alison Campbell (UK) and Joseph Teo (Singapore) invited parties’ views on expected outputs from the first Global Stocktake (GST).
In addition to a decision to be adopted by CMA 5, some parties supported a political declaration and a technical annex. Algeria, for the ARAB GROUP, said the GST needs to conclude before deciding on an annex.
Many parties underscored the need to adopt an outline for the CMA decision at SB 58. Suggestions as to the elements of the outline included:
assessment of progress towards the Paris Agreement’s objectives;
assessment of progress made in different thematic areas;
how to address identified gaps;
opportunities for enhanced support;
follow-up steps with regard to nationally determined contributions, national adaptation plans, and long-term strategies; and
GST follow-up.
Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), proposed including a transformational roadmap for the long-term goals. Colombia, for the ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC) proposed identifying international cooperation mechanisms required to enhance ambition. South Africa, for BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, and CHINA (BASIC), and Saudi Arabia, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), said the outline should provide a balanced assessment of the information collected, including on the pre-2020 ambition gap and financial issues. CANADA opposed including a pre-2020 ambition assessment and emphasized balancing sobering messages with hopeful ones. CHINA said sectors should not be selected from a mitigation-centered perspective and emphasized information on thematic areas should be structured to ensure comparability.
Work programme on just transition pathways: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Selam Kidane-Abebe (Zambia) and Marianne Karlsen (Norway), parties continued sharing their views on how to flesh out the work programme. Points related to, among others, developing countries’ right to development and understanding challenges related to decarbonization. Several countries cautioned against a “mitigation-centric approach.”
A developing country underscored that the issue of just transition is broader than response measures and called for the work programme to focus on the multilateral system’s role in supporting just transition pathways. One developed country called for an overview of existing work on just transition under the UNFCCC to avoid duplication.
The Co-Facilitators will draft text ahead of the next session of informal consultations.
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
IPCC in-session technical workshop on findings on emission metrics contained in its Sixth Assessment Report: SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls opened what he called a “space for dialogue between the scientific community and parties,” in which IPCC authors presented findings from AR6 and fielded questions about common emission metrics. The Secretariat presented an overview of the history of metrics in UNFCCC processes, highlighting the use under the Convention of the global warming potential metric with a 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) based on AR5 values. IPCC authors stressed that AR6 GWP-100 values “more robustly” account for carbon cycle responses and that reporting on both long- and short-lived gases allows more transparency in temperature projections and net-zero calculations. They emphasized the “right” metric depends on policy objectives, principles, and how metrics are applied. Parties sought clarification on, among others, the effect of methane reductions on warming.
In the Corridors
“This sure is not making our work any easier,” quipped an exhausted delegate as news of yet another proposed addition to the Subsidiary Bodies’ agendas reverberated across the venue. The proposal by the Like-Minded Developing Countries to talk about “urgently scaling up financial support in this critical decade” was reported to have blown up like a bomb in consultations among Heads of Delegation.
With the continuing lack of agreement on the agenda, some said many questions remain up in the air. A particular concern is whether the outcome of the discussions on contentious items–but all items, really–will be captured at the end of the meeting and therefore be used as a basis for discussions at COP 28. “Let’s hope all this work won’t go down the drain,” said a delegate engaged in the negotiations on the just transition work programme.
“We’ll just have to see where things go. Things can change in a single day,” mused a cautiously optimistic delegate. “Four years ago no one would have anticipated we’d have virtual participation opportunities,” another added, recalling a positive development from the major pivot the global community made during the pandemic."
7,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-daily-report-8jun2023,True,Daily report for 8 June 2023,"Discussions on loss and damage finance took center-stage at the Bonn Climate Conference, with civil society urging delegates to “fill the fund.” In other parts of the venue, negotiations opened on the mitigation work programme and on national adaptation plans, and discussions continued on a range of items.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Methodological issues under the Convention: Greenhouse gas data interface: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Thiago Mendes (Brazil), the Secretariat indicated it would take between 6 and 12 months to develop the new GHG interface, at a cost of EUR300,000. Some countries expressed reservation in giving the Secretariat a mandate without funding, while others expressed concern over delaying the process any longer. However, many parties supported a proposal from a developed country to defer consideration of the matter to SB 60, with a developing country expressing a preference for deferral to SB 62. The Co-Facilitators will produce draft conclusions.
Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Martin Cames (Germany) and Pacifica F. Achieng Ogola (Kenya), parties discussed draft conclusions text. Some developed countries called for deleting a paragraph that notes divergent views expressed by parties on submissions by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), while developing countries stressed the paragraph accurately reflected discussions and should remain in the draft text.
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia). On the process of authorization of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs), several developed and developing countries stressed that authorization should not be revoked or changed after they have been transferred so as to not undermine the market, and for transparency and environmental integrity.
On the process of first transfer of mitigation outcomes, several parties called for guidelines on how authorization should be handled and how changes should be reported to ensure transparency, with one developed country proposing the creation of a repository.
Some developing countries called for the Secretariat to draft a technical paper on the definition and identification of common nomenclatures to ensure consistency and help guide the work on the agreed electronic format.
Two developing country groups called for establishing basic principles and guidelines on how to address the special circumstances of least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) with respect to their participation in cooperative approaches.
Rules, modalities, and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) sought feedback from parties on the connection between the Article 6.4 registry and Article 6.2 international registry.
Several developed countries said units from Article 6.4 registry should not only be transferable to the Article 6.2 international registry, but also to Article 6.2 national registries, recognizing that these two approaches can co-exist and be accommodated. One proponent pointed out that the process of transferring units would be similar to the Kyoto mechanism so parties already know it works.
A few developed countries asked about the costs of connecting the Article 6.4 registry with Article 6.2 international registry. One developing country called for guidance and provision of capacity building from the Secretariat on the operation of the Article 6.4 registry.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare an informal note.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Reporting and review pursuant to Article 13 of the Paris Agreement: provision of financial and technical support to developing country parties for reporting and capacity building: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Eve Deakin (UK), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) reported on progress in the provision of GEF support for developing countries’ reporting.
Parties welcomed an informal note prepared by the Co-Facilitators that sets out elements on context, challenges developing countries face, and ideas for addressing these. A developing country group pointed to the transition from reporting under the Convention to reporting under the Paris Agreement’s enhanced transparency framework (ETF) as the context of discussions. He pointed to significant differences between developing countries in terms of reporting infrastructure and highlighted electronic reporting as a particular challenge. Many developed countries called for referencing existing support initiatives. A developed country called for streamlining the list of potential solutions.
The Co-Facilitators will revise their informal note.
Second review of the functions of the Standing Committee on Finance: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Ali Waqas (Pakistan) and Gabriela Blatter (Switzerland). The Co-Facilitators reported on guidance by the SBI Chair and Secretariat regarding a developing country group’s point of order questioning the mandate to prepare a draft CMA decision. They pointed to decision 15/CMA.4 in which the CMA affirms decision 15/CP.27 on the second review of the functions of the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF). They invited parties’ views on draft SBI conclusions, noting the text contains elements on areas of improvement identified by parties as well as guidance to the Secretariat for the preparation of the technical paper on the review. Several parties cautioned against preempting findings on areas of improvement. Several groups and parties suggested changes to the text, with discussions centering on the user-friendliness and gender-responsiveness of SCF outputs.
The Co-Facilitator will revise the draft conclusions.
National adaptation plans: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Antwi Boasiko (Ghana) and Jens Fugl (Denmark), developing countries stressed the equal importance of adaptation and mitigation. They further underscored key challenges constraining the formulation and implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs), including technological constraints and other capacity gaps, and the need for predictable funds to move from NAP formulation to implementation. Parties converged on inviting the Adaptation Committee (AC) and the LDC Expert Group (LEG) to report on their NAP-related work during the next informal consultations. Some developing countries suggested also extending invitations to the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) and other relevant constituted bodies.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Sharm el-Sheikh mitigation ambition and implementation work programme: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand) recalled that convening the consultations does not pre-empt consultations on the adoption of the agendas, and whether the outcome of the consultations will be captured depends on the adopted agendas.
Parties commented on lessons learned from the first global dialogue and investment-focused event under the work programme, which took place immediately prior to the SBs. Many parties called for relevant documentation on such events to be distributed earlier to facilitate preparation and foster participation by stakeholders relevant to the specific themes, especially those from outside the UNFCCC process, such as financiers and policy brokers.
Parties proposed including case studies and world café-style discussions, framing the next dialogue with “how” questions, and convening regional dialogues. On topics for future dialogues, they suggested: building renewable energy capacity for those without energy access; energy transition; and decoupling economies from fossil fuels.
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Second Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage: In opening remarks, SBI Chair Nabeel Munir recalled the COP 27/CMA 4 mandate for the second Glasgow Dialogue to focus on the operationalization of the new funding arrangements and fund.
Cuba, for the G-77/CHINA, called for a free-standing entity of the Financial Mechanism. JAPAN, GERMANY, and SWITZERLAND urged for a mosaic approach. Several developing country groups and countries called for finance by developed countries. NEW ZEALAND, FRANCE, and others emphasized exploring innovative sources of funding.
Argentina, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, and URUGUAY (ABU), Timor-Leste, for the LDCs, and CANADA called for agility to quickly disburse funding in the case of sudden need. Several groups and countries emphasized the need to consider slow-onset events within the funding arrangements. JAPAN and the US stated there is no one size fits all approach to address all types of loss and damage.
ABU, the BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA (ALBA), the AFRICAN GROUP, the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), the ARAB GROUP, and the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs) underscored the funds should be available to all developing countries. AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND, JAPAN, and the US said the most vulnerable developing countries should be prioritized.
Youth Stocktaking: An assessment of the challenges for youth inclusion in UNFCCC processes and a roadmap for the future: Incoming COP 28 President Sultan Al Jaber (UAE) pointed to the designation of a Youth Climate Champion for COP 28, noting the aim to foster inclusiveness.
COP 28 Youth Climate Champion Shamma Al Mazrui (UAE) stressed the need to challenge “how things have always been done,” asking “what if oil industry leaders are leading the transition?”
Echoing concerns about ties to the fossil fuel industry, YOUNGO called on the COP 28 Presidency to be a “champion of change.” She cautioned against “youth washing” and “tokenism.” As pathways for effective youth engagement, she pointed to: youth inclusion in party delegations; access to funding and capacity building; and formal recognition of the Global Youth Statement.
Several parties shared experiences on the role of youth in their delegations, with MEXICO indicating it trains its youth delegates to participate as negotiators.
In the Corridors
“We are here to hold the process accountable,” emphasized a civil society participant, as she folded up her banner after one of several protests that took place at the World Conference Center. The decision on establishing funding arrangements for loss and damage was widely hailed as the big success of the Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Change Conference. But now it is key to “fill the fund,” as her banner read.
Yet the opening of the second Glasgow Dialogue showed how far apart countries are on various operationalization modalities, especially: What sources will feed the fund? Who will be eligible? And how quickly will funds be disbursed? Protesters had a clear answer to the first of these questions.
“Make polluters pay,” they chanted, as they demanded barring participants with conflicts of interest from engaging in the climate negotiations process. Many of the worries about risks of obstruction were directed at the just-arrived Sultan Al Jaber, the President-Designate of the upcoming climate conference to be held in the UAE. During the Youth Stocktake, the youth constituency voiced this concern directly, and challenged the Presidency to instead demonstrate it will be a champion for change. "

Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change: In informal consultations co-facilitated by María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Maria Samuelsen (Denmark), parties discussed draft conclusions.
Across multiple paragraphs related to the work programme’s mandate, parties called for language to reflect that the programme is open to all countries, while keeping emphasis on developing countries, including least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). On the organization of an event on adaptation monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems, many parties suggested it cover “all adaptation actions and support, including transformational adaptation” rather than “adaptation and transformational adaptation.”
Research and systematic observation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Elizabeth Bush (Canada) and Ladislaus Chang’a (Tanzania), parties discussed draft SBSTA conclusions and a draft COP decision related to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) .
On the draft conclusions, parties suggested references to topics addressed during the 15th Research Dialogue, including transboundary climate risks, countries’ scientific research capacity, and how rising temperatures could limit nature-based carbon removal. They also discussed language on encouraging the IPCC to take research gaps and needs into account when scoping out its Seventh Assessment cycle.
On the draft decision, parties discussed language noting research gaps and underscoring AR6 as the most comprehensive IPCC report to date.
The Co-Facilitators will revise the draft texts.
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia).
On possible recommendations for the preparation of the manual for reporting tools, two developing country groups called for featuring illustrative examples, such as on assumptions and information on leakage, to enhance transparency, consistency, and ease of comparability. Others emphasized the non-binding nature of the manual, with one developed country group preferring the manual not to have country-specific examples.
Noting there is no current cooperative approach expressing non-greenhouse gas metrics, a developed country group called for focusing on Article 6 implementation, rather than on hypothetical scenarios.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare an informal note.
Subsidiary Body for Implementation
Reporting from non-Annex I parties: Provision of financial and technical support: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Sandra Motshwanedi (South Africa), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) provided an update on GEF support for developing country reporting under the Convention.
The Co-Facilitators then invited views on draft conclusions, which parties welcomed. One developing country group expressed concerns over the differing level of detail and ways of capturing discussions on support for reporting under the Convention and under the Paris Agreement, noting interlinkages between both agenda items.
Another developing country group called for simplifying the application process for countries that have already had support approved in previous support cycles. Several developed countries agreed the application process should be streamlined, with one country cautioning the need to ensure due diligence and alignment with the GEF cycle. The Co-Facilitators invited parties to consult informally and submit language for inclusion in revised draft conclusions.
Matters relating to capacity-building: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Catherine Goldberg (US) and Gonzalo Guaiquil (Chile), parties agreed on draft conclusions on the annual monitoring of the capacity-building framework under the Convention.
Parties also discussed a Co-Facilitators’ proposal for a draft COP decision on terms of reference for the second review of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB). Some parties suggested additions to the scope of the review, such as references to inadequate financial support. One developed country cautioned against prejudging the outcome of the review. The relevant section of the annex was bracketed.
Several developed countries proposed inviting the CMA to participate in the second review of the PCCB as it relates to the Paris Agreement.
The Co-Facilitators invited parties to consult informally.
Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings: SBI Chair Munir chaired the contact group. Many developed countries stressed that host country agreements must be transparent, publicly disclosed, provide for protections of the right to free speech, and ensure harassment and intimidation of any participant are not tolerated.
Several developed countries supported inviting non-party stakeholders’ statements after country groups and before individual parties. Some developing countries opposed, emphasizing the country-driven nature of the process.
With regard to CMA 5, a developing country said there was no agreement to include Article 2.1.c (making financial flows consistent with a low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development) on the agenda, while another party disagreed.
National adaptation plans: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Antwi Boasiko (Ghana) and Jens Fugl (Denmark), parties heard from the Adaptation Committee (AC) and LDC Expert Group (LEG) on the bodies’ work to support the formulation and implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs). Parties’ ensuing questions related to, among others, the type of training provided to developing countries, regional balance of such training, and work undertaken with the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF). On how gaps and needs are assessed, the AC noted it relies on submissions by parties.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Matters relating to the Santiago Network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Cornelia Jäger (Austria), some parties identified their preference on the host for the Network, with some favoring the Caribbean Development Bank and others the consortium between the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and the UN Office for Project Services.
On the draft conclusions, many developing countries called for:
clearer guidelines on the development of the Memorandum of Understanding with the host, including on the independence of the Network from the host, and on managing conflict of interest;
a timeline for operationalizing the Network; and
details on funding for the work of the Network, including expectations regarding the host’s in-kind support.
Developed and developing countries diverged over the issue of the Network’s advisory board members’ privileges and immunities, specifically their consistency with the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations.
Discussions will continue in informal-informals.
Work programme on just transition pathways referred to in decision 1/CMA.4: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Selam Kidane-Abebe (Zambia) and Marianne Karlsen (Norway), the Secretariat provided an overview of the work on just transition in various UNFCCC processes. The Co-Facilitators then invited parties’ views on an informal note that contained sections on, among others, objectives, scope, and modalities.
Developing countries objected to a mitigation-centric approach, emphasizing the need to consider just transition in the context of sustainable development, and urged unlocking means of implementation. Several developed countries noted just transition is a tool for facilitating enhanced ambition and also pertains to developed countries. Environmental NGOs (ENGO) highlighted countries’ differing fiscal space and access to resources.
Several developed countries called for the Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures (KCI) to serve as an expert body, with several developing country groups opposing. Many parties called for streamlining the section on interlinkages, noting the list is non-exhaustive. Various groups and parties called for references to, among others, a human rights-based approach to just transition, climate justice, people with disabilities, and aging workers.
The Co-Facilitators will revise their informal note.
Sharm el-Sheikh mitigation ambition and implementation work programme: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Carlos Fuller (Belize) invited parties to continue commenting on the lessons learned from the first global dialogue and investment-focused event, held on 5 June 2023. Many speakers supported making the events hybrid and using innovative discussion formats.
Topics proposed for future events included: renewables; energy efficiency; and carbon capture, utilization, and storage. One party stressed the sub-topic and guiding questions for future events should be narrowly focused.
A developing country group noted that, without agreed SB agendas, the informal consultation does not have a clear mandate and its discussions may not be reflected in an outcome. Others welcomed the convening of the group. Co-Facilitator Fuller said the next informal consultations will discuss possible conclusions.
Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Technical dialogue of the first Global Stocktake: Harald Winkler (South Africa) and Farhan Akthar (US), Co-Chairs of the technical dialogue of the first Global Stocktake (GST), invited participants to comment on what the GST’s key messages on means of implementation (MOI) should be.
Cuba, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed the IPCC’s recommendations to accelerate financial support and ensure financial flows meet needs. SAUDI ARABIA said financing has been inadequate since 1992. The EU noted parties to the Paris Agreement agreed finance should be mobilized from all sources and called for addressing fossil fuel subsidies and putting a price on carbon. Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), said the IPCC showed there is sufficient finance, but it is geographically imbalanced. She called for contributions from emerging high-income countries in order to move from billions to trillions, and stressed the need to send key messages to the private sector. The US indicated the USD100 billion goal will be met in 2023 and technology transfer is increasing.
Uruguay, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, and URUGUAY (ABU), called for addressing the barriers faced by developing countries in receiving MOI. Lamenting increased debt, Bhutan, for the LDCs, urged for grants. India, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), noted co-financing requirements create barriers.
Samoa, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), said many developed countries’ policies to achieve the long-term goal on finance do not take into account extraterritorial impacts. He also called for eliminating the “workshop culture” on capacity building and to think about ways to attract and retain capacity in developing countries. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES (LGMA) noted the lack of capacity in local governments to identify and implement climate-related projects.
Second Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage: In breakout group discussions, parties and observers exchanged views on the capacities of existing institutions to respond to loss and damage and the best way to ensure funding addresses not only immediate needs but also medium- and long-term recovery needs of local communities.
Cuba, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed loss and damage financing should not increase debt loads but should be easily accessible, appropriate to different national circumstances, and recognize different time scales of climate events. BANGLADESH urged solutions-oriented approaches with windows that address immediate responses and longer-term rehabilitation needs. He noted the existence of gaps in the current system, including a “gap of integration” among funding sources. Brazil, for ABU, stressed the need for loss and damage funding to be new, additional, and adequate and suggested that it could include trigger mechanisms to expedite disbursement.
GUINEA emphasized loss and damage as a development issue and pointed to existing humanitarian institutions as “part of the solution but not the solution.” NORWAY noted the need to address the question of what happens in the long term after humanitarian organizations finish immediate response efforts.
The STOCKHOLM ENVIRONMENT INSTITUTE suggested considering ways to distribute loss and damage funds through small grants that communities can directly access, ultimately taking ownership of funds so they can use them “according to their own needs.”
In the Corridors
Finance negotiators were especially busy, taking the floor in multiple rooms throughout the day. While protesters called for governments to “fill the [new loss and damage] fund” earlier in the week, debates at the mid-way point of the conference focused more on whether past pledges are being met, who is receiving existing funding, and how quickly.
“It just takes so much time to fill out all these application forms,” shared a developing country representative, “and then you still have to wait months, sometimes years to get the funds.” When it comes to loss and damage, such delays are simply not acceptable, underscored many in the Glasgow Dialogue.
Heads of Delegation experienced a delay of a different kind: “No lunch until there is agreement on the way forward with the agendas,” they were told. Stomachs growling, some presented a compromise proposal to move beyond the remaining contentious issues, but others were holding out hope for a different conclusion on the issues of “urgently scaling up financial support in this critical decade” and mitigation ambition."
9,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi58-sbsta58-summary,False,"Summary report, 5–15 June 2023","With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) underscoring once more the urgent need for enhanced climate action, and less than six months to go before the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) convenes in Dubai, delegates had their work cut out for themselves in Bonn. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) featured over 20 items on their respective agendas and more than 20 mandated events had to be crammed into the schedule, including on big ticket issues such as loss and damage, the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, and the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement.
One thing that this conference will be remembered for is that, up until the penultimate day, the lack of agreement over the agendas for the 58th meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB 58) hung like a sword of Damocles over the negotiations. Despite consultations among Heads of Delegation before the conference, there was no agreement. Parties nevertheless worked on the basis of the SBSTA’s provisional agenda and the SBI’s supplementary provisional agenda. Negotiations went on largely undisturbed, but whether their outcome would be captured and forwarded to the COP in November hinged on agreement on the agenda.
Heads of Delegations managed to sort out some of the disagreements, notably by removing reference to specific paragraphs in the title of the agenda item on the work programme on just transition pathways. But the proposed inclusion of an agenda item on the mitigation ambition and implementation work programme (MWP) remained problematic.
The European Union and the Environmental Integrity Group had submitted a request to add it ahead of the conference. But that sparked debate. Three days into SB 58, the Like-minded Developing Countries proposed what some dubbed “a counter item” on “urgently scaling up financial support from developed countries in line with Article 4.5 of the Paris Agreement to enable implementation for developing countries in this critical decade.” Parties engaged in lengthy discussions on these two items, both in consultations among Heads of Delegation and in plenary. Neither ultimately made it onto the agendas. However, since the MWP was on the provisional agendas going into the meeting, consultations took place on the matter and the SB Chairs will prepare an informal note capturing the discussions.
Delegates also had heated debates over the recognition of the IPCC’s findings. Many developing and developed country groups and parties underscored AR6 is the most robust and comprehensive assessment to date. But one developing country held up agreement, pointing to “disputes” among IPCC members and emphasizing knowledge gaps. Many groups and parties expressed concerns over the weak language in SB 58’s draft decisions on AR6.
Overall, progress remained rather elusive as parties:
could not agree on recommending a host for the Santiago Network on loss and damage;
did not advance the development of a framework for guiding the achievement of the Global Goal on Adaptation and the review of overall progress in achieving it; and
only noted an indicative draft structure of the decision on the Global Stocktake, which contains four options for the title of a section on finance.
The 58th meetings of the SBSTA and SBI convened from 5-15 June 2023 at the World Convention Center in Bonn, Germany. 5,647 people were registered for on-site participation and 1,249 for virtual-only participation in the meeting, without counting party overflow, staff, and holders of temporary badges.
A Brief History of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement
The international political response to climate change began with the 1992 adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which sets out the basic legal framework and principles for international climate change cooperation with the aim of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, has 197 parties.
To boost the effectiveness of the UNFCCC, parties adopted the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997. It commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve quantified emission reduction targets for a basket of six GHGs. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and has 192 parties. Its first commitment period took place from 2008 to 2012. The 2012 Doha Amendment established the second commitment period from 2013 to 2020. To date, 145 parties have ratified the Doha Amendment.
In December 2015, parties adopted the Paris Agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement, all countries will submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and will review the aggregate progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation every five years through a Global Stocktake (GST). The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016. To date, 193 parties have ratified the Agreement.
Recent Key Turning Points
Paris: The 2015 UN Climate Change Conference convened in Paris, France, and culminated in the adoption of the Paris Agreement on 12 December. The Agreement includes the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. It also aims to increase parties’ ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and make financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development. The Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.
Under the Paris Agreement, each party shall communicate, at five-year intervals, successively more ambitious NDCs. Under the common timeframes decision adopted in 2021 in Glasgow, each NDC will last ten years, but will still be updated every five years. The Paris Agreement also includes a process known as the GST, which convenes at five-year intervals to review collective progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation. The Agreement further sets out an Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) and includes provisions on adaptation, finance, technology, loss and damage, and compliance.
When adopting the Paris Agreement, parties launched the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) to develop the Agreement’s operational details. Parties also agreed on the need to mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action by all parties and non-party stakeholders to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals. Several non-party stakeholders made unilateral mitigation pledges in Paris, with more than 10,000 registered actions.
Marrakech: The UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech took place from 7-18 November 2016, and included the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA). Parties adopted several decisions related to the PAWP, including: that work should conclude by 2018; the terms of reference for the Paris Committee on Capacity-building; and initiating a process to identify the information to be provided in accordance with Paris Agreement Article 9.5 (ex ante biennial finance communications by developed countries). Other decisions adopted included approving the five-year work plan of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM), enhancing the Technology Mechanism, and continuing and enhancing the Lima work programme on gender.
Fiji/Bonn: The Fiji/Bonn Climate Change Conference convened from 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, under the Presidency of Fiji. The Conference of the Parties (COP) launched the Talanoa Dialogue, a facilitative dialogue to take stock of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals. The COP also established the “Fiji Momentum for Implementation,” a decision giving prominence to pre-2020 implementation and ambition. Parties also provided guidance on the completion of the PAWP and decided that the Adaptation Fund shall serve the Paris Agreement, subject to decisions to be taken by CMA 1-3. Parties also further developed, or gave guidance to, the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, the Executive Committee of the WIM, the Standing Committee on Finance, and the Adaptation Fund.
Katowice: The Katowice Climate Change Conference convened from 2-14 December 2018 in Katowice, Poland, concluding a busy year that featured an additional negotiation session to advance work on the PAWP. Parties adopted the Katowice Climate Package, which finalized nearly all of the PAWP, including decisions to facilitate common interpretation and implementation of the Paris Agreement on the mitigation section of NDCs, adaptation communications, transparency framework, GST, and financial transparency, among others. Work on cooperative approaches, under Article 6 of the Agreement, was not concluded, and parties agreed to conclude this work in 2019. The COP was unable to agree on whether to “welcome” or “note” the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5°C of Global Warming.
Chile/Madrid: The Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference convened from 2-13 December 2019 in Madrid, under the Presidency of Chile. Delegates adopted decisions on the review of the WIM and some finance-related issues, such as guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Green Climate Fund (GCF). Parties established the Santiago Network for Averting, Minimizing, and Addressing Loss and Damage, and adopted the enhanced five-year Lima Work Programme and its Gender Action Plan. Parties also adopted three cover decisions under the different governing bodies, each named the Chile/Madrid Time for Action. On many other issues, notably Article 6 and long-term finance, parties could not reach agreement.
Glasgow: The Glasgow Climate Change Conference convened in Scotland from 31 October 2021 – 12 November 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic-related interruption. Parties finalized the Paris Agreement rulebook, adopting guidelines, rules, and a work programme on Article 6 and agreeing on the format of reporting under the ETF. Parties adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact, a series of three overarching cover decisions that, for the first time, included a reference to phasing down unabated coal power and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. They also agreed to work programmes on a global goal for adaptation, and on urgently scaling up mitigation; created the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage; established a process towards defining a new collective quantified goal on climate finance; and launched an annual dialogue on ocean-based climate action.
Sharm El-Sheikh: The Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference convened in Egypt from 6-20 November 2022 and concluded with the adoption of 60 decisions. For the first time, parties recognized the need for finance to respond to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change and established a fund and the necessary funding arrangements, with the details to be worked out in 2023. Key elements in the package leading to this agreement were work programmes on urgently scaling up mitigation ambition and the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). Parties also adopted two overarching cover decisions, together called the Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan. Highlights of the cover decisions include:
retaining the call to phase down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, as adopted in the Glasgow Climate Pact;
urging parties that have not yet communicated new or updated NDCs or long-term low GHG development strategies to do so as soon as possible before CMA 5;
establishing a work programme on just transition to discuss pathways to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement; and
calling for multilateral development bank reform.
The meeting also launched the selection process for the host of the Santiago Network secretariat and continued the technical dialogue under the GST, among other issues.
Report of the Meetings
The Bonn Climate Change Conference opened Monday, 5 June. Executive Secretary Simon Stiell encouraged parties to “be brave” and prioritize the common good, noting this perspective would serve national interests. He said discussions on mitigation are key to unlock innovation, which must be used to revise and strengthen NDCs and long-term strategies. He highlighted that a strong agreement on just transition can enable action, build trust, and drive transformative development.
Sweden, for the EUROPEAN UNION, called for enhanced and immediate transformation of all sectors to reach net zero by 2050. He expressed optimism that developed countries will meet the USD 100 billion climate finance commitment in 2023.
Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, urged to keep a clear focus on 1.5°C ahead of COP 28 and called for all GHGs to be included in NDCs, which should also reflect parties’ ambitions to reduce and peak emissions by 2025. They also welcomed the United Kingdom to the group.
Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), highlighted that “we are on the brink of missing out on 1.5°C,” and reminded participants the upcoming GST provides the only chance to avoid an overshoot and adopt a full range of decisions to this end. He called for a mosaic approach to loss and damage funding and reiterated the importance of non-party stakeholder involvement.
Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, said discussions on the GGA should conclude with a decision that advances the resilience of developing countries. He also stressed: National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) should be a standing item on the SBI agenda; COP 28 is the “GST COP” and the outcome should help countries implement their NDCs; and a trust fund and work programme on just transition should be adopted at COP 28.
Samoa, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), emphasized the need to ratchet up ambition through the outcome of COP 28 on the GST, MWP, and GGA, and the need to operationalize fit-for-purpose funding for loss and damage, focusing on particularly vulnerable countries.
Senegal, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), underscored that funding is not keeping pace with the growing need for building adaptation capacities in the face of increasingly extreme climate events. He lamented that loss and damage is being sidelined in the GST discussion and progress on gender equality has been slow.
Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), said negotiations must be inclusive, transparent, and guided by the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. He stressed the importance of balanced texts and reiterated “our people are suffering from a climate crisis they have not contributed to.” He noted some countries are “playing to the gallery” but not fulfilling pledges.
Costa Rica, for the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), said the GST is a chance for multilateralism to build a global response to the “pivotal challenge” of climate change and called on the Subsidiary Bodies to develop a decision-making roadmap thereon. She called for COP 28 to agree on a fund on loss and damage and stressed the need to step up efforts to eliminate fossil fuels with clear dates.
Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, called for balanced work, emphasizing the importance of attention to adaptation, and urged that discussions should not deviate too much from the achievements of COP 27. She reiterated the importance of financial and technological support for developing countries to address climate change and eradicate poverty.
Papua New Guinea, for the COALITION OF RAINFOREST NATIONS, urged for the findings of the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report to feed into the SBs’ work. She highlighted that addressing land-use change poses the most promising and immediate opportunity to achieve reductions in emissions.
South Africa, for BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, and CHINA (BASIC), noted the importance of the GST in identifying gaps and spurring an enhanced global response. He called for more finance to support developing countries’ climate action.
Uruguay, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, and URUGUAY (ABU), called for concrete results from the technical dialogue of the GST and a clear mandate on targets and indicators to achieve the GGA.
Venezuela, for the BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA (ALBA), stressed that loss and damage funding must be predictable, adequate, and stem mainly from public funds. She urged a climate justice, rights-based approach to just transition and emphasized the need for non-market based approaches to strengthen implementation, while avoiding “unilateral coercive” measures that restrict development.
The IPCC highlighted the robust scientific knowledge contained within the reports of the sixth assessment cycle.
The WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (WMO) stated there is a 66% chance the world will temporarily exceed 1.5°C of warming due to the effects of El Niño.
The INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION highlighted maritime transport’s indispensable role in global trade and noted their efforts to develop measures and solutions to the industry’s contribution to air pollution and climate change, and support island states and developing countries.
WOMEN AND GENDER, emphasizing there is “no climate justice without gender rights,” highlighted the need to support care work and social protection and called on parties to “ensure a full, fair fossil fuel phaseout.”
CHILDREN AND YOUTH underscored that, inter alia: visa issues have reduced youth participation in the SBs; delayed action is shifting the burden to frontline communities and future generations; climate finance goals must “get out of the UNFCCC silo”; and the IPCC must be shielded from the influence of polluters.
BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY called for scaling up mitigation ambition, leaving Bonn with a “robust text” on Article 6, and setting an ambitious goal that would “supercharge” climate finance.
ENVIRONMENTAL NGOs stressed that a “legitimate COP is a fossil fuel-free COP” and called for rapid, real emission cuts based on the principles of justice and equity, rather than relying on mechanisms such as carbon markets and geoengineering.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES called for: real emissions reductions at the source and rapidly phasing out fossil fuels rather than carbon offsets; prioritizing prevention in loss and damage mechanisms; and not combining their group with local communities.
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES called attention to a local community that has conducted its own equivalent of a global stocktaking process.
RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NGOs stressed the need for the GST to follow a science-led approach and include science that is generated in the Global South.
TRADE UNIONS called for including stakeholders in discussions to ensure there is a just transition, and clear and ambitious conclusions from the GST, including for a structured exit from fossil fuels.
Joint Opening Plenary
On Monday, 5 June, SBI Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan) and SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands) pointed to consultations with groups and parties on the SB agendas, both ahead of the meeting and throughout the morning. They noted there is no agreement, but parties converged on launching work on the basis of the SBI’s supplementary provisional agenda (FCCC/SBI/2023/1/Add.1) and the SBSTA’s provisional agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/1) with the understanding that consultations will continue and the agenda will be adopted at a later stage.
On Monday, 12 June, SBI Chair Munir and SBSTA Chair Vreuls invited parties to adopt the agendas, amending the title of item 8 to read work programme on just transition pathways referred to “in the relevant paragraphs of” decision 1/CMA.4.
Bolivia, for the LMDCs, delineated the rationale for a proposed additional agenda item on urgently scaling up financial support from developed countries in line with Article 4.5 of the Paris Agreement to enable implementation for developing countries in this critical decade. Supported by Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, he emphasized the need for balance between discussions on ambition and means of implementation and underscored the “record of broken promises and failed commitments” by developed countries.
Agreeing that finance is critical, the EU, US, UK, CANADA, NORWAY and Switzerland, for EIG, opposed the LMDCs’ proposal but indicated the MWP provides space to discuss finance. Samoa, for AOSIS, and Costa Rica, for AILAC, emphasized the importance of the MWP, with AOSIS underscoring it is a priority for the group, as it is key to staying below 1.5°C of warming.
The EU questioned the submission of a proposed agenda item after work was already launched at the opening of the meeting and pointed to other finance-related processes already established. The US emphasized Article 4.5 of the Paris Agreement does not specifically refer to support by developed countries. The LMDCs highlighted the lack of a CMA mandate to address the MWP at SB 58, noting the matter was added to the agenda at the request of some parties after the publication of the provisional agenda, and underscored the need for negotiations rather than dialogues on scaling up finance.
The PHILIPPINES urged moving forward and adopting the agenda. Venezuela, for ALBA, objected to the inclusion of the MWP, but expressed openness toward adopting the rest of the agenda. The EU, EIG, and AILAC opposed.
Parties could not reach agreement and consultations continued.
During an evening plenary on Wednesday, 14 June, the SBI and SBSTA adopted their respective agendas (FCCC/SBI/2023/1/Add.1 and FCCC/SBSTA/2023/1), with an amendment for the relevant agenda items to read “work programme on just transition pathways referred to in the relevant paragraphs of decision 1/CMA.4” and with the exception of the agenda items on the Sharm el-Sheikh mitigation ambition and implementation work programme, noting the understanding that work carried out on the MWP on Thursday, 8 June, Friday, 9 June, Saturday, 10 June, and Tuesday, 13 June, will be captured by the SB Chairs in an informal note issued under their own authority.
The SB Chairs expressed appreciation for parties’ flexibility in reaching an agreement and allowing work to be launched prior to the adoption of the agendas. They noted this does not set a precedent for future work.
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change: The Nairobi work programme (NWP) aims to facilitate and catalyze the development and dissemination of information and knowledge to support developing countries’ adaptation action and to build on the momentum of work to date and strengthen its role as the UNFCCC knowledge-to-action hub on adaptation and resilience. In informal consultations, co-facilitated by María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Maria Samuelsen (Denmark) on Wednesday, 7 June and Friday, 9 June, parties reflected on progress under the NWP (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/2), highlighting areas where further work should be strengthened and how to best support developing countries, in particular, in a regionally balanced way.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/L.1), the SBSTA, inter alia:
recognizes the NWP’s role in closing knowledge gaps to scale up action related to adaptation, particularly in developing countries;
recognizes the NWP’s work is crucial to facilitating the achievement of the goals of the Convention and the Paris Agreement;
notes the NWP’s role in addressing knowledge gaps identified by parties and the need to provide outputs and knowledge products in additional formats, including all six UN languages; and
requests the Secretariat strengthen the Universities Partnership Programme, striving for regional balance.
Research and systematic observation: Elizabeth Bush (Canada) and Ladislaus Chang’a (Tanzania) co-facilitated informal consultations on this item. On Tuesday, 6 June, parties lamented the absence of a separate agenda item for the consideration of the IPCC’s AR6, noting the “clear messages” and “new insights” provided by the report. Developing countries underscored equity as central to all aspects of climate change, including in the representation of developing countries among IPCC authors, and stressed the need to acknowledge gaps in knowledge and research needs. Parties agreed to mandate drafting of COP and CMA decision texts and a draft conclusions text.
Parties discussed draft conclusions on research and systematic observation and draft COP and CMA decisions on AR6 at informal consultations on Wednesday, 7 June, and Friday, 9 June, Monday, 12 June, and Wednesday, 14 June, among others. Discussions centered on achieving a balance between underscoring the progress of scientific understanding achieved since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), including references to AR6 as the most comprehensive assessment of climate change to date, and pointing to knowledge gaps and needs.
On the draft conclusions text, some developing countries suggested adding references to equity and historical responsibilities to a paragraph noting the urgency of action in this decade. Developed countries noted consideration of equity was included in a paragraph of the conclusions text related to knowledge gaps and research needs, although developing countries stressed the need to reference equity specifically in relation to action.
On the draft decisions text, many parties converged on recognizing AR6 as the most comprehensive and robust assessment of climate change to date. A developing country opposed the reference to “robust,” noting different countries have different definitions of the word, and suggested language expressing concerns with “disputes” and the “inclusiveness” of IPCC decision-making. Other parties noted the IPCC is a separate organization with its own rules and procedures beyond the purview of the UNFCCC. Parties were unable to reach agreement on these revisions.
During the closing plenary, CHILE, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, PERU, AOSIS, the EU, EIG, CANADA, NORWAY, the US, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, the UK, and LDCs expressed their disappointment over the outcome of the discussions, underscoring once again that AR6 is the most comprehensive and robust assessment of climate to date.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/L.7), the SBSTA, inter alia, notes significant advances in scientific understanding of climate change since AR5, as well as knowledge gaps and research needs related to, among others, transboundary risks, policy implications of different emission metrics, and the consideration of equity.
The SBSTA also recommends draft decisions for the COP (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/L.7/Add.1) and CMA (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/L.7/Add.2) that, inter alia:
recognize AR6 represents a more comprehensive and robust assessment of climate change than AR5, with an increased scope, compared with previous assessment cycles, providing integrated scientific, technical and socio-economic information; and
encourage the scientific community to continue expanding the scientific knowledge base on climate change and addressing knowledge gaps with a view to supporting the AR7 cycle.
Methodological issues under the Convention: Greenhouse gas data interface: This sub-agenda item relates to creation of an online data portal through the Secretariat website as part of technical review of the GHG inventories and other information reported by parties. Informal consultations on this item were co-facilitated by Thiago Mendes (Brazil) and Daniela Romano (Italy) and were held Thursday, 8 June, and Tuesday, 13 June, among others.
In informal consultations on Thursday, 8 June, the Secretariat indicated development of the interface would take up to year at a cost of EUR 300,000 and some countries noted concern over creating an unfunded mandate. A developed country proposed deferring consideration of the matter to SBSTA 60 (June 2024), while a developing country preferred deferring to SBSTA 62 (June 2025). Parties were unable to converge on this matter in informal consultations. Applying Rule 16 of the draft rules of procedure, the issue will be placed on the agenda for SBSTA 59.
Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport: Informal consultations on this sub-item took place on Thursday, 8 June, and Monday, 12 June, among others, and were co-facilitated by Martin Cames (Germany) and Pacifica F. Achieng Ogola (Kenya). Parties discussed submissions from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Discussing draft conclusions, some developed countries called for deleting a reference to divergent views expressed by parties on submissions by ICAO and IMO, while developing countries stressed the language accurately reflected discussions. Applying Rule 16 of the draft rules of procedure, the issue will be placed on the agenda for SBSTA 59.
Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement: Article 6 of the Paris Agreement recognizes that some parties choose to pursue voluntary cooperation in the implementation of their NDCs. Article 6.2 relates to direct cooperation between parties. Maria Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) co-facilitated informal consultations on Monday, 5 June, Tuesday, 6 June, Wednesday, 7 June, Thursday, 8 June, Friday, 9 June, and Monday, 12 June, among others.
Developing countries underscored the need for rapid capacity building to empower them to contribute to the technical discussions on the development of the agreed electronic format (AEF) for reporting annual information. Parties agreed a manual should be developed to assist with the preparation of the AEF, with some groups calling for featuring illustrative examples, such as on assumptions and information on leakage, and others emphasizing the non-binding nature of the manual and preferring to not include country-specific examples.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2023/L.6), the SBSTA, inter alia:
takes note of the Co-Facilitators’ informal note from SBSTA 58;
requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper without formal status on, among others, the process of authorization, the draft version of the AEF, and processes pertaining to inconsistencies identified in review and data on Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes;
requests the Secretariat to organize a hybrid workshop to consider the technical paper before SBSTA 59;
requests the Secretariat, in developing a manual containing illustrative elements of information for the initial report, updated initial report, and annex to the biennial transparency report (regular information), to consider including therein explanations of key terms and concepts, illustrative elements of information, templates, examples, and case studies that are not country-specific;
requests the Secretariat to regularly update the manual, noting the first version of the manual should be available by the end of 2023;
requests the Secretariat to prioritize, as part of the capacity-building programme, activities related to the preparation of the initial report;

The SBI also recommends that the COP (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.2/Add.1) and CMA (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.2/Add.2) conduct the second review of the PCCB, adopt the terms of reference for the second review, and invite submissions by 29 February 2024, for consideration at SB 60 (June 2024).
Arrangements for intergovernmental meetings: SBI Chair Munir conducted consultations on this item on Monday, 5 June, Wednesday, 7 June, Friday, 9 June, and Monday, 12 June, among other. Parties discussed, inter alia: possible locations for upcoming meetings of the COP; the need to ensure sessions are safe for all and to specify that no harassment, bullying, or reprisals should occur before, during, or after the COP; and the need to ensure greater participation from observer organizations from developing countries.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.10), on preparations for the UN Climate Change Conference to be held from 30 November to 12 December 2023, the SBI, inter alia:
requests the Secretariat to take note of the views of parties on the possible elements of the provisional agendas for COP 28, the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 18) and CMA 5; and
emphasizes the importance of openness, transparency, inclusiveness and adhering to established decision-making practice in making arrangements for the Conference.
On the host of future sessions, the SBI:
urges the Eastern European States to accelerate consultations with a view to presenting an offer to host COP 29 no later than at COP 28;
expresses appreciation to the Government of Brazil for offering to host COP 30 (November 2025);
notes that, in keeping with the principle of rotation among the UN regional groups, the President of COP 31 (2026) would come from the Western European and Other States;
encourages the Secretariat and hosts of future sessions of governing and subsidiary bodies and mandated events to make arrangements that will facilitate the inclusive and effective participation of parties and observer organizations, including timely issuance of visas, availability of affordable accommodation, a safe and secure conference venue for all, and ensure participants can exercise human rights included in human rights law without fear of intimidation and repercussions; and
notes that the host country agreement for sessions of the COP should be made publicly available.
On the efficiency of the UNFCCC process, the SBI:
invites parties and observer organizations to submit, by 31 March 2024, views on streamlining the provisional agendas of the governing and subsidiary bodies; and
requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper for consideration at SBI 60 (June 2024) on options for reducing overlapping items on the provisional agendas of the governing and subsidiary bodies.
On observer engagement, the SBI:
reiterates the urgent need for solutions to improve the representation of observer organizations from developing countries in the UNFCCC process;
recommends current and incoming COP Presidencies ensure open, inclusive, and meaningful engagement of observer organizations in the lead-up to, during and after sessions of the COP;
encourages parties to remain in plenary meetings to listen to all observer statements and consider including civil society, in particular youth, in their national delegations; and
requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper on options for increasing the participation of observer organizations from developing countries including, but not limited to, providing financial support.
Administrative, financial, and institutional matters: The SBI first took up this item and its sub-items on budgetary matters, the continuous review of the functions and operations of the Secretariat, the implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, and the UNFCCC annual report during its opening plenary on Monday, 5 June. UNFCCC Senior Director Chhaya Kapilashrami reported on the: continuous review of the functions and operations of the Secretariat; implementation of the headquarters agreement; and UNFCCC report (FCCC/SBI/2023/9). Delegates took note of the reports.
On the budget, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell informed the opening plenary that three budget scenarios had been presented: 0% nominal growth; actual needs based on COP mandates; and a proposed budget, which would result in 16% net growth. He also said parties are in arrears by EUR 30 million. SWITZERLAND said the level of arrears is unacceptable.
Discussions continued in a contact group co-chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Georg Børsting (Norway) on Tuesday, 6 June, and Wednesday, 7 June, among others. During their first discussion, parties said the Secretariat should focus the core budget on ensuring parties are carrying out their responsibilities and not for engagement with non-party stakeholders or implementation of recommendations from bodies other than the parties. One said the ETF tools should be funded with core funding, not through supplemental sources. A party suggested adopting a decision on how future budgets would be developed. Parties asked the Secretariat to prepare a 0% real growth budget option.
Following several contact group sessions, many developed countries agreed to a 19% increase in the core budget compared to the 0% nominal growth proposal. They also stressed: the increase was not linked to inflation; the methodology for calculating the budget should not be used in the future; and a large part of the ETF should be included in core activities. Some developing countries supported 0% nominal growth for the core budget, while one developing country group supported the actual needs scenario. Developed countries also stressed the need for transparency in future budget processes.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.11), the SBI, inter alia:
recommends a core programme budget of EUR 74,105,511 for the biennium 2024-2025;
requests the Secretariat to prepare a document that contains its applied policy and criteria for engagement and collaboration with non-party stakeholders, as well as safeguards to avoid any reputational or other risks, and make it available at least 60 days before the start of SBI 59; and
notes with concern the inadequacy of the budget for the biennium 2022-2023 to support all mandates from the parties and the increased reliance on supplementary funding.
The SBI also recommended a draft decision for consideration and adoption by COP 28 (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.11/Add.1). In the draft decision, the COP, inter alia:
approves the programme budget for the biennium 2024-2025;
underscores that in implementing the work programme, the functions of the Secretariat relating to parties and non-party stakeholders are distinct and should not be co-mingled;
confirms the new activities for the biennium relating to non-party stakeholders should focus on enhancements to the global climate action portal (Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action platform);
requests the Secretariat’s engagement and collaboration with non-party stakeholders, including through the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, shall be funded through supplementary budget resources and partnerships;
notes the Secretariat is committed to updating its partnership policy with a view to ensuring its inclusivity and the wide geographical distribution of future partnerships;
urges parties that have not made contributions in full to the core budget for the current and/or previous bienniums to do so without further delay;
takes note of the funding estimates of EUR 13.5 million for the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process specified by the Executive Secretary for the biennium 2024-2025 and the funding estimate of EUR 152.3 million for the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities specified by the Executive Secretary for the biennium 2024-2025;
recalling paragraph 22 of decision 22/CP.21 and paragraph 20 of decision 21/CP.23, in which the Executive Secretary was requested to include a zero nominal growth scenario in the same format and at the same level of detail as any other scenario, requests the Secretariat to present zero real growth and actual needs scenarios in future biennium budget proposals;
requests the Secretariat to actively engage with parties in developing future biennium budget proposals;
reiterates that activities in the core and supplementary budgets must respond accurately and effectively to mandates from parties; and
adopts an annexed indicative scale of contributions from parties to the Convention for 2024-2025.
The SBI also recommends two draft decisions for consideration and adoption by CMP 18, one (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.11/Add.2) in which the CMP adopts the indicative scale of contributions from parties to the Kyoto Protocol for 2024-2025, and another on the budget for the international transaction log (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.11/Add.3), in which the CMP approves the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 2024-2025, amounting to EUR 3,321,311.
National adaptation plans: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Antwi Boasiko (Ghana) and Jens Fugl (Denmark), parties heard updates on the work of the Adaptation Committee (AC) and the LEG and progress on development and implementation of NAPs. On Thursday, 8 June, developing countries underscored central issues for the discussions, particularly gaps and needs constraining formulation and implementation of NAPs, including technological and other capacity constraints, and the need for predictable funding.
In informal consultations on Friday, 9 June, the AC and LEG Chairs elaborated on their work to collaborate with other constituted bodies, including the SCF and on training and other events designed to help developing countries develop NAPs. On Tuesday, June 13, parties proposed to underscore Indigenous and scientific knowledge as important for developing NAPs. Developing countries also suggested language requesting the AC and LEG to report on experiences addressing gaps and needs and to organize training for developing countries. Parties did not reach consensus on the informal note.
SBI Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.5), the SBI agrees to continue consideration of this matter at SBI 59, including on the basis of the draft text elements prepared by the Co-Facilitators at SBI 58.
Agenda Items Considered Jointly by the SBSTA and SBI
Review of the progress, effectiveness, and performance of the Adaptation Committee: In informal consultations co-facilitated by María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Morgane Chiocchia (UK), parties considered the work of the AC, including its support for developing countries and the GGA. In informal consultations on Tuesday, 6 June, parties generally spoke positively about the work of the AC, but developing countries highlighted the issue of balanced representation of the Global South among technical experts, the need for more resources to accomplish AC tasks, and the need to collaborate with partners in ways that are reflective of all regions.
In informal consultations on Saturday, 10 June, parties considered draft conclusions text, with developed countries supporting language highlighting the role of the AC in the Paris Agreement and developing countries seeking clarity on the matter.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2023/L.2), the SBs agree to continue consideration of this agenda item at SB 59 on the basis of the draft text elements prepared by the Co-Facilitators at SB 58.
Glasgow–Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation referred to in decision 7/CMA.3: The Paris Agreement established the GGA and CMA 3 created the two-year work programme to better understand, conceptualize, and ultimately achieve this goal. Informal consultations, co-facilitated by Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) and Janine Felson (Belize), took place on Saturday, 10 June, Monday, 12 June, Tuesday, 13 June, and Wednesday, 14 June, among others. Debates centered on whether and how to capture possible elements for the development of a framework for guiding the achievement of the GGA and the review of overall progress in achieving it.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2023/L.4), the SBs, inter alia:
take note of the views presented by parties at SB 58;
consider possible structural elements for a draft CMA 5 decision; and
invite submissions by parties and observers on the outcomes of and work conducted under the work programme.
The possible structural elements are:
preamble;
acknowledgement of progress and conclusions under the Glasgow–Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the GGA;
establishment of the framework for the GGA;
elements of the framework for the GGA: purpose;
dimensions;
themes;
general and cross-cutting considerations;
enabling conditions (option 1) or means of implementation (option 2);
reporting;
overarching targets and specific targets, indicators and metrics (option 1) or shared adaptation priorities under the framework for the global goal on adaptation (option 2);
link to the GST;

Matters relating to the Santiago Network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Cornelia Jäger (Austria) and Lucas di Pietro (Argentina) on Tuesday, 6 June, Wednesday, 7 June, Friday, 9 June, and Tuesday, 13 June, among others, parties discussed draft conclusions based on the report of the evaluation panel on a potential host for the Santiago network secretariat (FCCC/SB/2023/1) and welcomed the potential hosts for presentations.
Some parties expressed disappointment in only receiving two proposals to host the secretariat. On the matter of the hosts themselves, there were concerns from some countries on the ability of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) to attain sufficient global reach with their network, and in the case of the consortium between UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), whether they would have the ability to ensure sufficient technical expertise despite the scope of their work on risk reduction.
Other points related to, among others, the host’s in-kind contributions, the handling of conflicts of interest, and the efficient use of the funds for technical assistance and capacity building.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2023/L.7), the SBs agree to continue consideration of this matter at SB 59, taking into account the draft text prepared at SB 58.
Matters relating to the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement: This joint item considers the outcome from the first GST, which is the process that aims to assess the world’s collective progress in implementing the Paris Agreement. In a contact group co-facilitated by Alison Campbell (UK) and Joseph Teo (Singapore), parties discussed their preferred outcomes during meetings on Saturday, 10 June, Tuesday, 13 June, and Wednesday, 14 June, among others.
In addition to a decision on the GST, some speakers also supported recommending that the CMA adopt a political declaration and a technical annex. A developing country group objected, saying the GST needs to conclude before an annex is agreed. Most of the discussions focused on elements for an outline to guide deliberations during an October 2023 workshop that will develop elements related to the GST outputs. Among other items, parties disagreed on whether and how the “indicative” draft structure should refer to funding, with several developed countries insisting “financial flows” should be included in the outline prior to “means of implementation and support,” and many developing countries suggesting the outcome should address the pre-2020 ambition gap and focus on “means of implementation and support” but not “financial flows.” The conclusions include four options for this part of the outline.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2023/L.3), the SBs, inter alia:
request the co-facilitators of the technical dialogue to prepare the summary report on the third meeting of the technical dialogue by 15 August 2023 and the factual synthesis report by 8 September 2023;
take note of the views exchanged on the indicative draft structure of a decision on the GST to be adopted by CMA 5 and noted the indicative draft structure of the CMA 5 decision contained in an informal note by the Co-Chairs of the contact group;
invite parties and non-party stakeholders to submit views on the elements for the consideration of outputs component by 15 September 2023; and
request the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on these submissions and to make it available on the UNFCCC website three weeks before the October workshop.
The indicative draft structure includes five sections:
preamble;
context and cross-cutting considerations;
collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, including under Article 2, paragraph 1 (a-c), in the light of equity and the best available science, and informing parties in updating and enhancing, in a nationally determined manner, action, and support;
enhancing international cooperation for climate action; and
guidance and way forward.
The third section, on collective progress, includes five sub-sections: mitigation; adaptation; [four options on finance flows and means of implementation and support]; efforts related to loss and damage; and efforts related to response measures.
The bracketed options for the third sub-section are as follows:
finance flows and means of implementation and support;
means of implementation and support, including finance flows;
means of implementation and support; and
making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, with a “bis” section on means of implementation and support.
Work programme on just transition pathways referred to in the relevant paragraphs of decision 1/CMA.4: The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan adopted at CMA 4 established the work programme for discussion of pathways towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement outlined in Article 2.1 in the context of Article 2.2. In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Selam Kidane Abebe (Zambia), Marianne Karlsen (Norway), and Luisa Rölke (Germany), the SBI and SBSTA initiated consideration of this work programme. Discussions took place on Tuesday, 6 June, Wednesday, 7 June, Friday, 9 June, Monday, 12 June, and Tuesday, 13 June, and the group sought to provide input to support the preparation of a draft decision for consideration by CMA 5 that fleshes out the work programme.

some calling for annual decisions on outcomes, while others preferred summary reports from the SB Chairs or the Secretariat;
suggestions on a one-, two-, or three-year mandate, with many emphasizing it should feed into the second GST;
objections from developing countries to a mitigation-centric approach, emphasizing the need to consider just transition in the context of sustainable development; and
emphasis from developing countries that the work programme should address how the multilateral process will support nationally-determined just transition pathways.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2023/L.5), the SBs, inter alia:
agree to continue work on the matter at SB 59, informed by the informal note from SB 58;
invite submissions by parties and observers on different elements of the work programme;
request the Secretariat to organize a workshop to be held before SB 59 to inform further work thereon, ensuring broad participation of parties and observers; and
request the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on parties’ submissions to inform their discussions during the workshop.
Sharm el-Sheikh joint work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Lucia Perugini (Italy) and Milagros Sandoval (Peru), parties considered the establishment of a new joint work programme on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security, including a road map highlighting workshop topics and the creation of an online portal to capture parties’ submissions. In informal consultations on draft conclusions text on Saturday, 10 June, developing countries urged financial support for workshop attendance, while developed countries questioned whether the text was the correct place for finance items. Parties also discussed the scope of an annual synthesis report and who should be contact points for online portal submissions.
On Tuesday, 13 June, a developing country group introduced a proposal specifying rules and procedures for a coordination group, which parties discussed in informal-informals.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2023/L.1), the SBs establish the Sharm el-Sheikh joint work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security and agree to continue consideration of this matter at SB 59.

On Tuesday, 6 June, developing country groups called for allocating more time for discussion of the midterm review, while developed countries called for concluding the midterm review and moving to discussing guiding questions for the review of the functions, work programme, and modalities of the forum.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2023/L.6), the SBs agree to continue consideration of this matter at SB 59.
Selected Mandated Events and Other Sessions
Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue: This event, mandated by COP 26, was the second in a series of annual dialogues aimed at strengthening ocean-based climate action. The two topics for this year’s dialogue, which took place on Tuesday, 13 June, and Wednesday, 14 June, were coastal ecosystem restoration, including blue carbon, and fisheries and food security. Exploration of these topics featured breakout group discussions, followed by presentations.
Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, opened the dialogue by underscoring blue carbon as a nature-based solution and warning about the risks of ocean-based carbon dioxide removal.
Breakout discussions highlighted, among others: the need for awareness of coastal ecosystem benefits, including engagement with coastal communities; de-risking investments; and gathering and monitoring data, including mapping blue carbon areas.
Presentations on coastal ecosystem restoration pointed to mangrove and seagrass projects, as well as the creation of new “blue bonds” that provide financial flows to restoration projects. Presentations on fisheries and food security emphasized Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge and solutions and spurred discussions of strategies for equitable investment, including ensuring projects respond to the needs of women.
Parties and observers highlighted ways to thread the role of the ocean into climate change mitigation and adaptation through UNFCCC processes, including the GST, by including ocean-based climate action and ocean science in countries’ NDCs and integrating ocean action into constituted bodies’ work plans.
SBSTA–IPCC special event on the findings in the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC: This event, held Monday, 5 June, highlighted findings from the IPCC’s AR6 cycle, including the much deeper reductions in emissions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee opened the special event by underscoring the need for emissions to drop by half within seven years, relative to 2019. He emphasized “the future depends on the choices we take now.” In his remarks covering the three themes of AR6—current status and trends; future climate change, risks and, long-term responses; and responses in the near-term—Lee noted half the world’s population lives in highly vulnerable areas, and the 1.1°C rise in global average temperature from 1850-1900 levels means that many people are experiencing soft limits on adaptation. He underscored the need for increased finance and cooperation to achieve a livable future.
During the event, IPCC experts answered questions related to where adaptation limits are being experienced and how AR6 improves on AR5. Experts said low-lying coastal areas are experiencing adaptation limits and stressed AR6’s unequivocal attribution of climate change to human activities as a “huge advance” over AR5.
IPCC in-session technical workshop on findings on emission metrics contained in its Sixth Assessment Report: This technical workshop, held on Wednesday, 7 June, opened what SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls called “a space for dialogue between the scientific community and parties” about the findings on common emissions metrics in IPCC’s AR6. During the workshop, the Secretariat gave a historical overview of metrics within UNFCCC processes, leading to the use under the Convention of the global warming potential metric with a 100-year time horizon (GWP-100). IPCC authors noted improvement in AR6 GWP-100 values, particularly in relation to carbon cycles, but stressed the “right” metric depends on policy goals and how metrics are applied. During a question-and-answer period, parties asked for clarification, among others, on the effects of methane reductions, which IPCC authors noted can reduce additional warming.
Third meeting of the technical dialogue under the first Global Stocktake: The third and final meeting of the technical dialogue under the first GST comprised opening and closing plenary sessions, four roundtable discussions, and a world café. The roundtables addressed: mitigation, including response measures; adaptation, including loss and damage; means of implementation and support: finance, technology, and capacity building; and integrated and holistic approaches.
During the opening plenary, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell emphasized the GST process would be “legacy making” and its outputs would frame decisions at COP 28 and beyond. Co-Chairs Harald Winkler (South Africa) and Farhan Akthar (US) said over 170,000 pages of information have been uploaded to the GST information portal. The GST Explorer, which facilitates searches of the submitted information, was presented during a side event.
During the closing plenary, SBI Chair Munir stressed the GST is one of the most consequential events for the UNFCCC in 2023. SBSTA Chair Vreuls highlighted the innovative discussion approaches used during the GST and the online tool to harvest information submitted during the technical phase. Co-Chairs Winkler and Akthar highlighted that the GST would result in a technical dialogue synthesis report, a summary report of the third technical dialogue, and a CMA decision. 
Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage: COP 26 established the Glasgow Dialogue to discuss the arrangements for funding activities to avert, minimize, and address loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change. The second dialogue was held on Thursday, 8 June, Friday, 9 June, and Saturday, 10 June, with breakout group sessions taking place on the second day. The dialogue was co-facilitated by Outi Honkatukia (Finland) and Richard Sherman (South Africa). In opening remarks on the first day, SBI Chair Munir recalled the COP 27/CMA 4 mandate for the second Glasgow Dialogue to focus on the operationalization of the new funding arrangements and fund, and inform the work of the transitional committee.
Presentations from experts and party interventions focused on support for different phases of loss and damage, and their respective preferences for a stand-alone fund or a mosaic approach. A UN Climate Change High-level Champion reflected on ways in which the new funding arrangements and fund could collaborate with non-state actors, including the private sector.
In breakout group discussions on the second day, parties and observers exchanged views on the capacities of existing institutions to respond to loss and damage and the best way to ensure funding addresses not only immediate needs but also medium- and long-term recovery needs of local communities and should not increase the debt loads of developing countries. Speakers emphasized funding windows and triggers that ensure timely and effective support across all phases of loss and damage, from preparedness and immediate responses to events, to recovery and rehabilitation phases.
On the third and final day, additional presenters explored how a variety of NGOs and institutions can coordinate with the fund and maximize support from existing funding arrangements responding to loss and damage.
Technical Expert Dialogue under the Ad hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell opened this two-day dialogue on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG) by calling for “bold and creative thought” to unlock the trillions of dollars needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
On Monday, 12 June, scene-setting presentations underscored the scale and range of assessments of the range of finance needed, which differ in terms of time frames, sectors, and baselines and range from cumulative USD 105-275 trillion needed to reach net zero by 2050. Finance experts also called for tripling public funds, which must mobilize higher multiples of private finance. During breakout sessions, participants underscored the need for predictability and accountability, while noting that contributions based on gross domestic product (GDP) may not be predictable.
Breakout sessions continued on Tuesday, 13 June, addressing sources of finance and the relation between the NCQG and Article 2.1.c of the Paris Agreement (aligning finance flows). Participants urged taking into account lessons learned from the USD 100 billion goal, especially with regard to mobilization of private finance, and to align finance flows not only with climate objectives but also with biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction. Suggestions for future work include burden sharing arrangements between developed countries and tracking the impacts of climate finance.
Executive Secretary meeting with observers: Executive Secretary Stiell shared reflections on ongoing Secretariat-led work on strengthening observer engagement in the UNFCCC process, noting enhanced consideration of the needs of persons with disabilities in site design and pointing to capacity building for youth delegates. He highlighted measures aimed at addressing conflicts of interest, underscoring participant lists will now feature information on all badge types. He said participants will be asked to specify their organizational affiliation and opting-out thereof will be noted on the lists.
Observers welcomed increased transparency as a valuable first step. They called for clear guidance on legitimate reasons for opting out, noting it should be limited to security considerations. Observers also called for having participants disclose their financial sponsorship, with exceptions for at-risk communities. Executive Secretary Stiell welcomed these remarks, noting ongoing discussions on sponsorship declarations.
Closing Statements
On Thursday, 15 June, Executive Secretary Stiell underscored his resolve to ensure the safe and secure participation of all in UNFCCC meetings, with no tolerance for bullying and sexual harassment. He called on all parties to focus on building bridges and convincing their national treasuries and cabinets of the necessity to invest in climate action. He also announced that, going forward, participant lists from UNFCCC meetings will feature information from participants of all badge types, including their affiliation, with a view to enhance transparency.
SBI Chair Munir said SB 58 had unlocked some issues that have been locked for decades, and encouraged parties to rebuild trust and remember “negotiation is not an end in itself.” SBSTA Chair Vreuls noted SB 58 had achieved results, but could have achieved more.
Cuba, for the GROUP OF 77 AND CHINA, said the decision on research and systematic observation was not reached because developed countries did not want to recognize equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. He reported it was encouraging to see the new work programme on just transition pathways moving forward, as it is a key part of the full implementation of the Convention.
The EU said divisive narratives are a zero-sum game. He regretted the SBs were unable to discuss the MWP and called for space at every SB session for such discussions. He reported the EU stands by their climate finance commitments, but added that financing the transition will require increased finance from all sources. He looked forward to selecting the host for the Santiago Network and to developing the framework for the GGA at COP 28. He also called for future COP hosts to uphold the human rights of participants and to ensure open, inclusive, and meaningful engagement.
Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, expressed concern that the IPCC AR6 was not recognized as the most comprehensive and robust assessment yet of climate change, welcomed progress on a structure for the GST, noted disappointment that parties could not agree on a host for the Santiago Network, and welcomed discussions on linkages between the finance and technical mechanisms.
Switzerland, for EIG, stressed that the first GST in Dubai must reach an “ambitious and actionable conclusion,” including an expansion of renewable energy, decarbonization, and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. He noted it was “highly problematic” that the MWP was not formally launched and lamented the lack of agreement on the host of the Santiago Network. Mexico, for EIG, officially announced the departure of Franz Perrez (Switzerland) and commended him for his “superhero” energy and expressed appreciation for his decade of work in the UNFCCC process.
Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, emphasized developed countries should take the lead in climate action. He noted targets, metrics, and indicators are crucial elements of the GGA and expressed concern about efforts by developed countries to focus on types of finance rather than financial obligations. He welcomed AR6 and stressed it must inform work on climate change based on principles of equity.
Samoa, for AOSIS, underscored the process must be supported by the best available science. She lamented the lack of agreement on putting the MWP on the agenda and called for the decision on a host for the Santiago Network to be determined by merit and the host’s track record of supporting vulnerable countries.
Bolivia, for LMDCs, expressed concern over attempts to separate the Paris Agreement from the Convention and refusal from some parties to make substantive progress and “capture what progress has been made.” He called for developed countries to “pay their climate debt” rather than shifting the burden to developing countries.
Senegal, for LDCs, expressed concern that negotiations are not meeting the required level of urgency, as climate change continues to get worse with each degree of warming. She called for strong engagement at the upcoming Climate Ambition Summit and lamented parties’ lack of willingness to sufficiently fund the Secretariat despite the increased scope of its mandates.
Venezuela, for ALBA, expressed regret that developed countries had failed to reach the goal of providing USD 100 billion in climate finance by 2020. She said the mechanism on loss and damage should be operationalized quickly.
Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, said development progress should be the foundation of efforts to mitigate emissions. She looked to the GST to help focus efforts on adaptation and loss and damage.
Papua New Guinea, for the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS, highlighted the achievements of REDD+ and said the first GST will be the most significant outcome at COP 28.
South Africa, for BASIC, welcomed work on just transition pathways and recognized a wide diversity of pathways. He expressed concern with efforts by developed countries to “impose new interpretations of the Paris Agreement” and link financial flows to policy and commercial interests. He emphasized the need to achieve a global financial system “fit for purpose for sustainable development.”
Costa Rica, for AILAC, regretted the absence of the MWP from the agenda and stressed adaptation as a priority, with GGA as a key component for reducing the risks of climate change. She urged improving connections between Technology Mechanism and Financial Mechanism and closing the technology gap.
Brazil, for ABU, stressed adaptation as a priority, lamented the lack of a decision on a host for the Santiago Network, and underscored finance, technology, and capacity building are key.
The UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, as the incoming COP 28 Presidency, said humanity is at “a watershed moment” and urged transformational change and bold outcomes at COP 28. He highlighted the need to get back on track to keep 1.5°C degrees within reach while leaving no one behind.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES called for preventing maladaptation and violations of rights. She said the green energy revolution should not perpetuate Indigenous Peoples’ exclusion from energy systems.
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES said the second Habitat Assembly adopted a resolution calling for enhancing the interlinkage between urbanization and climate change resilience.
RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NGOs praised the IPCC’s role, suggested further work on Indigenous knowledge, and called for integrating health, biodiversity, and the Ocean into the climate agenda.
TRADE UNIONS expressed concern that the COP 28 Presidency wants to reduce just transition to an energy issue for only the Global South.
WOMEN AND GENDER stressed that rights cannot be realized without scaled up funding for mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage.

A Brief Analysis of the Bonn Climate Change Conference
“The collective response remains pitiful, [...]
we are hurtling towards disaster,
[...] it is time to wake up and step up.”
UN Secretary-General António Guterres
Negotiators commonly report that “everyone is equally unhappy” with an agreement on a contentious issue. As odd as it might sound, this is a positive spin on the outcome of tough negotiations because it indicates parties engaged in a give-and-take that led to a compromise containing elements that were agreeable to all. However, coming out of the 58th session of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB 58) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), it was evident that many delegates were just plain unhappy—unhappy with the process and equally unhappy with its outcome.
Many are desperate for step-changes on numerous fronts. They want the UNFCCC to be more efficient and effective, to be more inclusive and transparent, and to facilitate enhanced climate action in line with the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement.
This brief analysis picks up on some of these aspirations, reflecting on discussions held in Bonn and their implications for future meetings and change on the ground. The analysis is framed using the call by COP 28 Youth Climate Champion Shamma Al Mazrui (United Arab Emirates) to challenge how things have always been done by asking “what if?”
What if… we cleaned up the process?
One thing was clear from the outset: SB 58 would be “jam-packed.” The SBs had over 20 items on their respective agendas. In addition to the many time slots for informal consultations on these items, the SB Chairs highlighted they had to fit over 70 three-hour slots into the schedule to accommodate over 20 mandated events. A schedule like this doesn’t leave much room to breathe, especially for small delegations. It is draining for individual negotiators, and many think it also slows down progress in the negotiations, as there is little room to engage in candid discussions between country groups and come up with bridging proposals that move things forward, let alone consider the bigger picture. With rooms booked for back-to-back sessions, there wasn’t much opportunity for delegates to recess until the very last days of the SB meeting, when the schedule finally thinned out.
It is not only the sessions of the SBs and the Conference of the Parties (COP) that are jam-packed. The increasing number of workstreams and their associated submission deadlines and workshops eat into the intersessional period. During the SBs’ closing plenary, the UNFCCC Secretariat pointed to some of the new mandates from SB 58, including workshops and associated reports related to the just transition work programme, the Nairobi work programme on adaptation, and cooperative approaches under the Paris Agreement—all to be held in the remainder of 2023.
Obviously, this comes at a cost, both in terms of human and financial resources. Delegates need to digest new mandates, submit views, participate in workshops, and read reports. And the Secretariat needs to facilitate it all. Costs vary depending on the complexity of the task at hand. Technical papers are more extensive than synthesis reports, and online tools, such as for reporting under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), can take years and dozens of skilled people to develop. Workshops that take place during or around SB meetings or COPs are cheaper than stand-alone events, both for the Secretariat and attendees, although either way, many negotiators end up being on the road for significant periods of time.
Budget questions were overall very prominent at SB 58, as new Executive Secretary Simon Stiell presented his first proposed biennium budget to parties. Negotiators focused on how much the proposed budget has grown in “real” or “nominal” terms, rather than the actual cost to implement their mandates, and questioned what was proposed as part of the Secretariat’s core vs. supplementary budget. Ultimately, the SBs recommended the COP adopt a budget for which core costs—which are covered by parties’ assessed contributions—are half the size of the proposed “supplementary” budget activities for which the Secretariat must solicit specific funding. And yet, the growth in agreed mandates has to be funded one way or another.
“Surely you could fundraise from Bloomberg Philanthropies or the like to support the development of the accountability framework for non-party stakeholders’ climate action,” contemplated a seasoned observer. “Such a framework would be a welcome thing to rein in greenwashing, but the ETF tools should obviously be a priority.”
The Secretariat will surely face many challenges in navigating priorities and safeguard principles to implement these mandates. Executive Secretary Stiell reported that, while COP 25 in 2019 resulted in seven major mandates, COPs 26 and 27 resulted in 60 major mandates. “At this rate, who knows how many work programmes we’ll establish at COP 28,” wondered an observer.
While attention to these process-related questions is increasing, resolution isn’t in reach just yet. The agenda item on “arrangements for intergovernmental meetings” gave way to very constructive discussions, but it isn’t until SBI 60 (June 2024) that delegates will consider options for streamlining agendas or increasing the participation of observer organizations from developing countries, let alone decide on actual reforms. “There are a number of things we could lay to rest or turn dormant,” considered a negotiator, and a thematic bundling of agenda items would already be helpful. “For starters, let’s have simple, to-the-point workstream titles,” she implored. “We don’t need Presidencies to put a stamp on everything, crowding our agendas with their Glasgow-this, Sharm el-Sheikh-that.”
In one respect, SB 58 did bring one improvement to the process. In his closing statement, Stiell announced that, going forward, information on all participants’ organizational affiliation would be publicly disclosed. If greenhouse gas emissions weren’t still rising three decades into the life of the Convention, such a measure might not receive much attention. But news of corporate lobbyists flocking to the negotiations and the designation of an oil-executive as COP 28 President are making it increasingly difficult to defend the UNFCCC’s legitimacy. Civil society organizations welcomed this transparency measure as an important first step towards addressing conflicts of interest.
What if… we strengthened climate action?
Until the penultimate day of SB 58 it was unclear whether there would be any formal outcome of the meeting, as parties could not reach agreement on the SBs’ agendas. “This might sound like a bunch of bureaucrats haggled over nonsense to pass time,” noted a seasoned delegate, “but the disagreement struck right to the core of the process.”
In March 2023, the European Union and the Environmental Integrity Group requested the inclusion of the mitigation work programme on the provisional agendas. But that—and some other issues—sparked debate that held up their adoption at the outset of the meeting. It also motivated the Like-minded Developing Countries to propose what some dubbed “a counter item” on urgently scaling up financial support from developed countries three days into SB 58. Despite lengthy discussions, both in consultations among Heads of Delegation and in plenary, neither item ultimately made it onto the agendas. “We have a conundrum on our hands,” because the assessment is unequivocal. Mitigation is insufficient and needs to be drastically and swiftly ramped up, and developed countries have yet to deliver on their commitment to mobilize USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries’ climate action.
In terms of strengthening climate action, lack of progress on mitigation and finance is obviously problematic. Measuring progress at SB 58 based on these two issues somewhat misses the point, however. A more fitting assessment would be that the meeting never had the necessary ingredients for making big strides on either of these issues. Such progress would rather manifest through the outcome of and follow-up to the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement and the definition of a new collective quantified goal on climate finance at a level significantly above the current USD 100 billion commitment. Yet, the more fitting assessment of SB 58 isn’t any rosier, as the meeting largely failed to shift the needle on most of the issues where it was actually supposed to make significant progress.
Parties could not agree on a host for the secretariat of the Santiago Network on loss and damage. Yet doing so is key to finally operationalizing the Network, which was established in 2019 to catalyze technical assistance in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. They also did not make notable progress on the development of a framework to guide the achievement of the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and the review of overall progress in achieving it, with some saying adaptation ended up becoming a “hostage” of the mitigation vs. finance agenda debate. The GGA is a key component of the Paris Agreement, and delegates are set to adopt the framework at CMA 5, but SB 58 didn’t bring about much clarity on what this framework would entail, especially with regard to possible targets, indicators, or metrics.
As was apparent during the SB’s closing plenary, another big disappointment was the consideration of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the words of Saint Kitts and Nevis, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), it should be “a no-brainer” to acknowledge AR6 as the most comprehensive and robust assessment to date. But the SB 58 draft decisions merely recognize that AR6 represents a more comprehensive and robust assessment of climate change than AR5. AOSIS and many others underscored the pivotal role of the IPCC in supporting effective climate action and registered their dismay as to the conduct of negotiations on the matter, with agreement largely being held up by one developing country.
In comparison, many considered the discussions on the work programme on just transition pathways to have been quite fruitful. Granted, much remains to be resolved when it comes to fleshing out the programme and, as is typical for climate negotiations, developed and developing countries are far apart when it comes to the question of means of implementation. But many take this first exchange of views as a win, especially given that the establishment of the work programme was “catapulted into the cover decision in Sharm el-Sheikh without much of an actual discussion,” as one delegate recalled. All emphasize the importance of leaving no one behind in the necessary transition towards low-carbon economy, with Stiell and others emphasizing it is a key enabler of enhanced ambition. 
Progress on the just transition work programme doesn’t hold up too badly either when compared to the “relatively meager” advances on the first Global Stocktake (GST) to evaluate progress in implementing the Paris Agreement. While the GST technical dialogue’s Co-Chairs said the GST was fed with 170,000 pages of information and succeeded in getting parties and non-party stakeholders to engage on a range of issues, especially during world café sessions, it remains unclear how delegates will bring it over the finish line.
The conclusion of the first GST is the most awaited outcome of CMA 5: it is supposed to foster the ratcheting up of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to be submitted by the first quarter of 2025. As the IPCC’s latest findings shows, such a ratcheting up is crucially needed, as we are not collectively on track to reach the Paris Agreement’s objectives. Yet much work remains. All that parties could agree to at SB 58 was to note the indicative draft structure of the CMA 5 decision, although even that agreement has a large question mark. The indicative draft structure contains four different options for the title of a section on finance. “I have no idea how we are supposed to go from this to a strong call for action in just five months,” wondered a puzzled delegate.
What if… we looked to COP 28/CMA 5 to bring about a course-correction?
While short on specific accomplishments, the discussions and conclusions reached at SB 58 feed into important intersessional work. For one, there is the GST. The summary report from the technical dialogue of the first GST and the October 2023 workshop that is supposed to develop elements for the consideration of its output component could both pave the way for a course-correction. Whether the honest assessments of responsibility, acceptance of accountability, and restoration of trust necessary to deliver a step change, will be possible when these discussions move out of public view will largely determine how the debates in Dubai will be framed.
For another, there is the ever-present issue of finance. Albeit only in the form of dialogues, SB 58 laid the building blocks for the two defining finance issues: loss and damage finance and the new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG). Now all eyes are on the Transitional Committee tasked with making a recommendation to COP 28/CMA 5 on the operationalization of the funding arrangements and new fund for responding to loss and damage. Expectations are high for political guidance on the NCQG as well, both with respect to the quantum of the goal and to qualitative aspects such as concessionality. In this case, many are also looking for political guidance from discussions outside the UNFCCC process, including the Summit for a New Global Financial Pact taking place in late June 2023.
Finally, while mitigation was kept off the agenda at SB 58, it is likely to be the key issue the COP 28 Presidency will be evaluated on: How will they address the issue of fossil fuel phase-out? Will they pick up and advance the idea of a renewable energy goal? How much prominence will be allocated to technologies such as carbon capture and storage? The COP 28 Presidency kept a low profile in Bonn. Some noted they were “awfully quiet” during the agenda fight, which makes some observers worry the Presidency is not prepared to be the mediator it needs to be to secure a successful outcome in Dubai. But, circling back to COP 28 Youth Climate Champion Shamma Al Mazrui, “What if COP 28 becomes the defining moment for the necessary course correction?”"
