Many negotiation sessions went over time, as delegates tried to get disagreements sorted before running out of allocated negotiation slots. Some, such as those reflecting on the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP), managed to reach agreement. Others, such as discussions on the Mitigation Work Programme, seemed less optimistic.
Negotiations and Mandated Events
Procedural and Logistical Elements of the Overall Global Stocktake Process: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Thureya Al Ali (United Arab Emirates) presented an updated informal note.
On references to the Global Stocktake (GST) timeline, the EU, the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), and NEW ZEALAND underlined the importance of allowing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s seventh assessment cycle to inform the second GST, while the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs) stressed the independence of the IPCC’s timeline. AUSTRALIA suggested flexibility on whether the headings and structure of the first GST outcome are maintained in the second GST, while LMDCs argued for maintaining the first GST’s structure. The PHILIPPINES reminded parties that the informal note was meant to capture all views rather than serve as a negotiation document.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare a revised informal note and draft conclusions.
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Carlos Fuller (Belize) invited parties’ views on improving the work programme’s global dialogues, adding that other issues may also be discussed.
On improving future global dialogues, the AFRICAN GROUP called for investment-related events to be used to unlock funding, including from multilateral development banks and blended finance approaches. The US noted dialogues should consider the links between mitigation and broader policy contexts at all levels. Parties agreed on the need for more inclusive dialogues, including through possibly conducting regional dialogues, which the ARAB GROUP opposed.
On a potential informal note, the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS) requested that it include: reference to the importance of showcasing the best available science; key findings from global dialogues; and elements that could contribute to other aspects of the dialogues. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA noted that it should highlight mitigation-related outcomes of the GST and high-level messages, as well as procedural improvements for the work programme itself.
Co-Facilitator Fuller noted the item has run out of time for consultations at this session, and said the Co-Facilitators will draft procedural conclusions. SWITZERLAND and the US, on a point of order, requested more time for informal consultations. The Co-Facilitators will consult the Subsidiary Body (SB) Chairs. 
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: Co-Facilitator Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) invited views on draft CMA decision text, recalling that any agreed text will be moved to the draft conclusions text. Parties made various suggestions aimed at enhancing the document’s readability. They supported better “bucketing” of related issues, especially in the sections related to: sequencing and timing; the process of identifying, notifying, and correcting inconsistencies; and inconsistencies identified in Article 6 technical expert reviews.
The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), GRUPO SUR, and CANADA suggested that the draft text’s next iteration flag elements that are inconsistent with previous decisions. Other comments related to, among others: ensuring consistent terminology, for example with regard to “participating party” registries; ensuring interoperability between the different types of registries: and provisions for party-specific accounts in the international registry.
Heads of delegation will reflect on progress with a view to informing another round of informal consultations.
Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Pedro Pedroso Cuesta (Cuba), parties shared their views on the revised informal note.
The G-77/CHINA reiterated that the Adaptation Committee (AC) should not lead the mapping process on indicators, with LMDCs noting that Decision 2/CMA.5 already addressed the work programme on GGA indicators and how constituted bodies can support the work on adaptation. The EU opposed, stating that existing bodies such as the AC should be utilized to avoid duplication of work and make the mapping process more efficient.
AOSIS preferred that parties “recommend” rather than “nominate” experts. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION expressed concern about the new structures being proposed in the establishment of expert groups.
AOSIS, the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), LMDCs, and the EU supported having the SB Chairs conduct workshops instead of dialogues under the work programme on GGA indicators.
On criteria, AOSIS, the EU, and MEXICO agreed to mapping the set of indicators that are relevant to measuring progress towards one or more of the GGA targets and that such indicators be specific to adaptation.
Discussions will continue in informal informals.
Terms of Reference for the 2024 Review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Meredith Ryder-Rude (US), the Secretariat shared the budgetary implications of the proposed events and preparation of inputs to the review, noting total costs of EUR 143.000.
Discussions will continue in informal informals.
Second Meeting under the Ad Hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: Work programme Co-Chair Fiona Gilbert (Australia) introduced a second iteration of the input paper and urged parties to begin engaging on substance. Parties expressed their views on the text, identifying ways to further streamline it.
Many parties underlined the issue of access to finance as a key element of the goal, with PALAU calling for simplified access particularly for small island developing states (SIDS) and LDCs.
Parties also considered issues related to transparency arrangements. NORWAY called for building on the enhanced transparency framework (ETF). LDCs underscored a definition of climate finance as a key aspect of transparency. AOSIS urged for funds to be reported when released to the recipient countries. 
Just Transition Work Programme: In contact group discussions, Co-Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) invited views on draft conclusions text and a draft decision text.
The G-77/CHINA proposed that the draft conclusions “take note” rather than “welcome” the first hybrid dialogue under the work programme, with LDCs suggesting “acknowledge.”
The G-77/CHINA suggested that the topics for the second dialogue be decided “in consultation with parties” rather than through “taking into account submissions” by parties. The EU and US sought clarification on the suggestion.
On ensuring inclusive participation in the second dialogue, the G-77/CHINA suggested including language on increasing participation from developing countries. The US and JAPAN opposed. The G-77/CHINA clarified that the point was not to limit participation from any country, but to increase participation.
Reacting to the G-77/CHINA’s proposal that the Secretariat prepare an informal summary report of the second dialogue, the EU requested that the paragraph be bracketed and asked for the cost implications of such a suggestion.
The US, CANADA, and AUSTRALIA suggested deleting a paragraph encouraging holding the second work programme dialogue intersessionally.
The G-77/CHINA further suggested that the SBs develop a work plan at SB 61. The EU, US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, opposed, with CANADA arguing that such a plan would be premature.
Discussions continued in informal informals.
Dialogue on Experiences Relevant for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework: Executive Secretary Simon Stiell noted the need for a paradigm shift from thinking of reporting as a burden, to leveraging it as an opportunity to learn, design more effective policies, unlock finance, and direct resources to where they are most needed. Noting that countries have different starting points, he cautioned against “letting the perfect be the enemy of the good,” and called upon every country to play their part, following the example of Andorra and Guyana which have already submitted their first Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs). 
In a video message, the COP 29 Presidency encouraged all parties to submit their BTRs ahead of COP 29, pointing to training workshops such as on linkages between the ETF reporting tools and the IPCC’s inventory software. The COP 28 Presidency underscored the ETF is fundamental to the Paris Agreement architecture and pointed to the “Together4Transparency”-initiative, which provides capacity-building support. 
Participants shared their experience in gathering, analyzing, and managing data, highlighting key lessons learned including on:
the importance of establishing effective data arrangements and formalizing them legally;
the need to effectively communicate the purpose and benefits of the data collection in order to overcome industry pushback due to, among others, confidentiality reasons; and
the benefits of effective storage systems to help preserve institutional memory, improve communication between teams, and avoid inconsistencies.
Research and Systematic Observation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Patricia Nyinguro (Kenya) requested feedback from recent informal informals. Parties reported some progress, but disagreements arose on whether to consider paragraphs on follow-up activities on addressing research needs, with BOLIVIA arguing that these could not be considered until paragraphs on the research needs themselves are resolved. Several parties noted that the connections between them are not causal, and that they could be considered separately.
On research needs, BOLIVIA recommended deleting language on the continued need for scientific information to inform the development of more ambitious NDCs and on calling for further research on adaptation limits. CHINA noted that NDCs should be considered in a manner that respects national circumstances.
Disagreements arose on a way forward, with BOLIVIA objecting to further informal informals. Parties will submit their views to the Co-Facilitators to inform the preparation of a revised informal note.
Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Kajsa Fernström Nåtby (Sweden), parties shared views on a draft COP decision text.
The ARAB GROUP agreed to remove brackets around a paragraph on budgetary implications of LCIPP activities undertaken by the Secretariat. The US dropped the proposal to invite the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement to decide that the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) of the LCIPP shall also serve the Paris Agreement.
On language interpretation during FWG meetings and in mandated events under the LCIPP, GRUPO SUR and CANADA proposed that both formal and informal language interpretation be recognized to avoid increasing the budget. The Secretariat agreed to add the phrase “explore other arrangements,” to allow for the use of informal interpreters.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ ORGANIZATIONS emphasized that protecting and safeguarding Indigenous Peoples’ rights remain a priority, calling for parties to uphold these rights in all UNFCCC processes.
With these amendments, parties agreed on the draft decision text.
Joint Work on Implementation of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food Security: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Una May Gordon (Belize), the Secretariat noted the online portal will be ready by end of June 2024 and launched at SB 61. Parties shared views on revised draft conclusions text. 
Parties agreed on two workshop topics:
systemic and holistic approaches to the implementation of climate action in agriculture, food systems, and food security, understanding, cooperation and integration into plans; and
progress, challenges, and opportunities related to identifying needs and accessing means of implementation for climate action in agriculture and food security, including sharing of best practices.
Parties agreed to hold the first workshop at SB 62 (June 2025) in order to allow for the consideration of the report on the Standing Committee on Finance’s 2025 Forum, which will focus on “Accelerating climate action and resilience through financing for sustainable food systems and agriculture.” They agreed to hold the second workshop at SB 64 (June 2026).
Arrangements for Intergovernmental Meetings: In a contact group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan) invited views on draft conclusions text. On hosts of future sessions, the AFRICAN GROUP asked for clarifications on the current practice regarding public availability of host country agreements.
On increasing the efficiency of the UNFCCC process, the ARAB GROUP and LMDCs suggested language on following the rules of procedure when preparing provisional agendas and ensuring the process is party-driven. The AFRICAN GROUP, LMDCs, and ARAB GROUP objected to language on applying broad agenda titles. EIG and JAPAN supported encouraging the Bureau to take a more prominent role in the process. AUSTRALIA, NORWAY, the UK, and US acknowledged the need for further engagement on the matter, but urged for better capture of discussions held at SBI 60 and suggested the SBI Chair hold informal consultations ahead of SBI 62. 
On observer engagement, the EU and US objected to establishing a new trust fund for developing country observer participation, noting challenges with resourcing existing trust funds. The US objected to quotas. The EU cautioned that many observer organizations cannot be clearly assigned to either developed or developing countries. BRAZIL suggested specific provisions for observers of incoming Presidencies. 
Discussions will continue in informal informals.
Administrative, Financial, and Institutional Matters: In a contact group, Co-Chair Gabriela Blatter (Switzerland) invited views on revised draft decision text. She outlined revisions related to, among others: disaggregating references to the trust fund for participation and the trust fund for supplementary activities; and encouraging increased clarity in budget documents on whether activities are mandated or not.
Parties welcomed the revised text and suggested further changes. Debates centered on the suggestion to have the Secretariat present potential cost implications of decisions before they are agreed. After informal consultations, parties agreed to request that the Secretariat prepare an information document after each meeting of the COP to present additional mandated activities and their respective cost implications for parties’ information.
The Co-Chairs will revise the draft decision text.
In the Corridors
“Why the long line—are the Spice Girls playing or something?” One delegate’s early-morning quip ended up becoming a refrain on Monday, which saw delegates waiting long minutes for the previous session to end before they could begin their own consultations. As session after session went over time, a domino effect of sorts ended up playing out in the World Conference Center, such that some end-of-day consultations ended up starting half an hour late.
“There’s no way around it: it’s crunch time,” a seasoned observer noted. Many of the discussions ended with parties requesting—and, in more than one case, begging—for extra time to continue discussions in informal informals. Huddles proliferated, occasionally succeeding to unlock agreement.  
As UN security began ushering delegates out of certain sections of the building, the mood remained industrious, and several surveyed delegates anticipated sticking around several hours longer. “So begins a week of long nights,” one prophesied with an ironic smile. “Thankfully, it’s a short week.”"
1,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-11jun2024,True,Daily report for 11 June 2024,"The negotiators focused on the cooperative implementation of the Paris Agreement (Article 6) and the Global Goal on Adaptation barely had a minute of respite as they conducted discussions throughout the day. In the afternoon, delegates reflected on opportunities for enhanced ocean-based climate action.
Negotiations and Mandated Events
Procedural and Logistical Elements of the Overall Global Stocktake Process: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Thureya Al Ali (UAE) and Patrick Spicer (Canada) invited views on a revised informal note that captures elements of procedural and logistical refinements that could be made, in order to inform discussions at SB 61.
The LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs) considered that many of the group’s comments were not reflected in the informal note, urging for their inclusion. Many others agreed that elements important to them were missing, but the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), the EU, AFRICAN GROUP, and US nevertheless indicated willingness to forward the informal note as presented.
AILAC supported the Co-Facilitators’ invitation for parties to submit their key points for inclusion in a new iteration of the informal note. LMDCs underscored they want to see all their points reflected in the text as they were submitted. 
The Co-Facilitators will prepare a revised informal note.
Modalities of the Dialogue on Implementing the Global Stocktake Outcomes: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Ricardo Marshall (Barbados) and Patrick Spicer (Canada) invited views on a revised informal note. Parties reiterated their preferred vision as to the scope of the dialogue, with AILAC and the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs) outlining that their vision for the dialogue, to follow-up on all Global Stocktake (GST) outcomes with a focus on finance/means of implementation, can be considered a bridging proposal.
The EU called for reference to sustainable lifestyles, sustainable production and consumption, circular economy, action for climate empowerment, and aligning finance flows with the Paris Agreement. LMDCs cautioned against making the dialogue a “dumping ground for policy priorities” and invited developed countries to reflect their priorities in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and report on these in their biennial transparency reports (BTRs).
The ARAB GROUP underscored the non-binding nature of the GST, emphasizing its outcome is not prescriptive. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG) expressed opposition to framing the first GST’s outcome as a “menu of options.” EGYPT highlighted the objective for the dialogue to foster discussion on how to support developing countries in responding to the outcome of the first GST. 
The Co-Facilitators invited submissions to inform the preparation of a new iteration of the informal note. They will also prepare draft conclusions.
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: Kay Harrison (New Zealand) and Carlos Fuller (Belize) co-facilitated informal consultations.
Views diverged on how to capture discussions. The EU, ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), LDCs, AILAC, JAPAN, JAMAICA, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, and US supported capturing parties’ views in an informal note alongside producing draft conclusions. AILAC and the US further called for intersessional work through a call for submissions by parties on elements of a draft decision. The EU, opposed by KUWAIT, requested that the Secretariat produce a synthesis report on potential elements for a draft decision based on parties’ submissions. LMDCs, the ARAB GROUP, and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION argued that the Co-Facilitators should only produce procedural conclusions.
Parties also discussed potential improvements for the global dialogues, including, among others, informal exchanges with experts before the dialogues; more diversity in expert panels; a “world café”-style interactive event; encouraging participants to share their views rather than restate their negotiated positions; and for developed countries to provide more support for the global dialogues, including through hosting.
Several parties, including AOSIS, the UK, and REPUBLIC OF KOREA, expressed disappointment with the “limited progress” made in the room. The ARAB GROUP disagreed, but called out interventions from other parties that it considered as changing the mandate of the work programme. AILAC and the US argued that discussing how GST outcomes can be complementary with the work programme does not limit work programme discussions exclusively to the GST.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare procedural conclusions.
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway), parties reiterated comments made in the informal consultations on Paris Agreement Article 6.4 with regard to emission avoidance and an intersessional workshop.
AOSIS called for the Secretariat to report back to SBSTA on common nomenclatures. The EU suggested that the SBSTA reflect on the Secretariat’s development of administrative procedures for treating and reviewing confidential information, including a specific code of conduct for Article 6 technical expert review teams. Parties also discussed whether to continue consideration of further guidance on corresponding adjustments for multi-year and single-year NDCs at SBSTA 62 (June 2025) or SBSTA 68 (June 2028). 
Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) invited views on draft conclusions text. Parties’ views converged on:
considering the development of recommendations on further responsibilities of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body and of parties hosting Article 6.4 activities in order for such hosts to elaborate on and apply national arrangements for the mechanism at SBSTA 68 (2028); and
continuing consideration of emission avoidance and conservation enhancement at SBSTA 68 (2028), specifying that, until then, the mechanism only covers emission reduction and removal activities.
Debates centered on a possible intersessional workshop. Some convergence emerged around the idea that such a workshop would aim to foster convergence on “crunch issues” without developing a new iteration of draft text, with divergence remaining on whether or not to capture discussions in a report.
The UK, supported by SWITZERLAND but opposed by the ARAB GROUP and LMDCs, called for the Secretariat to present the estimated budgetary implications of this intersessional work. The EU highlighted that the draft conclusions include a paragraph specifying that the SBSTA take note of the budgetary implications. He underscored support for the workshop, noting the estimate is key to ensuring parties provide appropriate financial contributions. LMDCs pointed to discussions in the budget group on how to deal with budgetary implications and underscored its opposition to intersessional work if these were to be presented.
The Co-Facilitators will revise the draft conclusions and the elements for draft decision text. 
Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.8: In a contact group, Co-Chairs Jacqui Ruesga (New Zealand) and Kristin Qui (Trinidad and Tobago) invited views on revised draft conclusions text. 
BOLIVIA suggested the 2024 assessment should not only serve to improve and recommend the schedule for implementing activities in the second phase (2025–2026), but should also pertain to the work programme’s scope and approach. The US objected, recalling the objective to have an expedited and simple assessment in 2024, with a review of the work programme taking place in 2026.
Other debates related to, among others: whether to specify the topics discussed in the spin-off groups held at SB 60, such as nature-based solutions; whether and on what to invite submissions; and whether to request the Secretariat to prepare synthesis reports on these submissions.
Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Tina Kobilšek (Slovenia) and Pedro Pedroso Cuesta (Cuba), parties reported back on discussions during informal informals.
AOSIS noted that parties agreed for both the Adaptation Committee (AC) and the expert working group to play a role in the mapping of indicators, but had yet to agree on what those roles should be.
Despite several hours of discussions in various formats, including informal informals and huddles, parties did not reach agreement on outstanding issues.
The Co-Facilitators will revise their text based on the discussions and parties’ written submissions.
Second Meeting of the Ad Hoc Work Programme under New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: Work programme Co-Chair Zaheer Fakir (UAE) invited parties to continue providing views on commonalities they see in the revised input paper, including in the sections on principles, access, and transparency arrangements. Many parties identified areas where they considered there was some commonality, including on the need for better access and using the enhanced transparency framework (ETF) as a basis for the transparency arrangements, but with updates to make it fit for purpose. The EU identified collective tracking of progress, such as using the financial assessments produced by the Standing Committee on Finance.
Many developing countries lamented the “unbalanced” nature of the text, and some called for deletion of references they considered outside the group’s mandate, including references to expanding the contributor base or limiting the recipient base. The ARAB GROUP, CHINA, and others underlined the lack of proposals on the goal’s quantum and questioned how to discuss access and other issues without an idea of quantum. ECUADOR called for focusing on quantum and timelines.
In closing, Co-Chair Fakir said the Co-Chairs will:
produce a summary of the meeting, including information on progress made;
start preparations for the third meeting of the work programme;
prepare and publish guiding questions for those that want to make submissions ahead of the third meeting; 
invite submissions that update and consolidate elements and identify bridging ideas; and
prepare an input paper for the third meeting.
Just Transition Work Programme: Contact group Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) invited further views, noting that failing to agree on draft conclusions would mean starting over from nothing in Baku.
The US reported on agreements reached in informal informal discussions regarding draft conclusions, including, among others:
suggesting that the topics for the second dialogue would be decided by the SB Chairs “in a transparent and consultative manner”;
a new paragraph noting that the SBSTA agrees to work on elements from the outcome of the GST, with CHINA adding a suggestion that this should be done “in a balanced and party-driven manner”; and
bracketing language around the intersessional nature of the second dialogue.
On the draft decision, the AFRICAN GROUP, opposed by the US, reiterated its calls for developing a work plan. LDCs requested the deletion of a paragraph acknowledging the support available for developing countries’ just transition pathways. Calling the decision text “unbalanced,” the EU requested language highlighting the need to mobilize financial flows and build enabling environments for supporting developing countries.
Parties met again in the afternoon to find a way forward, but were unable to agree on either draft conclusions or draft decision text. Co-Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) announced that another meeting will be scheduled to agree upon procedural conclusions, and urged parties to keep all their conversations in mind going into discussions in Baku.
Research and Systematic Observation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Patricia Nyinguro (Kenya) and Frank McGovern (Ireland) introduced a new iteration of draft conclusions.
AOSIS, the EU, and US, opposed by the ARAB GROUP and GRUPO SUR, supported encouraging parties to strengthen their provision of support and capacity building for the research community.
On research needs, parties diverged on whether to refer to loss and damage, non-CO2 greenhouse gases other than methane, and the alignment of the financial system.
Discussions continued in informal informals.
Joint Work on Implementation of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food Security: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Annela Anger-Kraavi (Slovakia), parties agreed to forward the revised draft conclusions text for adoption at the Subsidiary Bodies’ closing plenary.
Annual Dialogue on Ocean and Climate Change: In this mandated event, SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls recalled that the first GST encouraged further strengthening of ocean-based climate action. 
Vidar Helgesen, Executive Secretary, Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (IOC-UNESCO), attending virtually, highlighted the need for timely access to ocean data to inform decisions and support countries in including ocean and marine-related elements in their NDCs and national adaptation plans (NAPs).
Kevin Magron, France, co-host of the 2025 UN Ocean Conference, noted that the Conference will focus on ocean-climate-biodiversity linkages and aims to showcase how international conventions such as the UNFCCC can successfully mainstream a holistic approach to addressing the ocean.
Executive Secretary Simon Stiell underlined that the February 2025 deadline for submission of updated NDCs presents an opportunity to push for greater coastal and marine adaptation and mitigation efforts. He said experiences shared at the Dialogue can enhance countries’ understanding of what is needed, highlighting the need for finance, technology, and innovation.
Panel discussions touched upon, among others:
mechanisms to track the extent and distribution of nutrients and plastic pollution in the ocean;
the recently adopted Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction;
approaches such as ecosystem-based adaptation, nature-based solutions, integrated coastal zone management, and adaptive management;
the Global Environment Facility (GEF)’s Blue and Green Islands Integrated Program that supports small island developing states (SIDS) in valuing ecosystem services;
the partnership between the GEF and the International Maritime Organization to address the issue of invasive aquatic species introduced via biofouling; and
ongoing work by the Technology Executive Committee on early warning systems and artificial intelligence.
In the Corridors
With only a day and a half of negotiations left before the closing plenaries, several delegates’ moods abruptly shifted for the worse on Tuesday. “To speak about a mitigation work programme for this many hours and still not come out with a definition of our own mandate… well, there’s got to be some kind of award for that,” one seasoned delegate grimly observed. 
Those with a big picture-view of the conference pointed out that several items had been concluded successfully. That list might still grow: some negotiators, such as those working on the Global Goal on Adaptation, still seemed intent on brokering an agreement.
Still, it was hard to ignore the disconnect between calls to ramp up ambition and the lack of progress in the conference center. “If countries don’t take the Global Stocktake’s messages seriously, there go our chances to stay in line with 1.5°C,” summed up a somber delegate."
2,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-12jun2024,True,Daily report for 12 June 2024,"Tension was palpable across the venue on the penultimate day of the 2024 June Climate Conference. Negotiators were keen to find agreement on outstanding issues—or at least ensure that discussions held in Bonn could feed into the next session. While progress was achieved on some issues, such as on the cooperative implementation of the Paris Agreement (Article 6), disagreements persisted in many others.
Negotiations and Mandated Events
Procedural and Logistical Elements of the Overall Global Stocktake Process: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Thureya Al Ali (UAE) and Patrick Spicer (Canada) presented a revised informal note and draft conclusions. The draft conclusions specify that the Subsidiary Bodies (SB) agree to continue consideration of this matter at SB 61 on the basis of the informal note with a view for the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) concluding the consideration at its sixth session (November 2024). Parties supported both documents with minor editorial changes. The draft conclusions will be forwarded for approval in plenary.
Modalities of the Dialogue on Implementing the Global Stocktake Outcomes: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Patrick Spicer (Canada) and Ricardo Marshall (Barbados) presented draft conclusions and a revised informal note. At the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES’ (LMDCs) request, parties agreed to specify, in the draft conclusions, that the informal note does not represent consensus views.
The Co-Facilitators will forward the draft conclusions for approval in plenary.
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: After opening remarks by SB Chairs Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands) and Nabeel Munir (Pakistan), Co-Facilitators Kay Harrison (New Zealand) and Carlos Fuller (Belize) presented draft conclusions text and an informal note produced under their own authority. They invited discussions on the draft conclusions, noting that the SB Chairs had recommended not to engage on the informal note due to diverging opinions between parties.
LMDCs, the ARAB GROUP, and others refused to engage on the draft conclusions or the informal note, arguing that parties had not mandated the Co-Facilitators to produce these documents. The Secretariat, at AUSTRALIA’s request, clarified that Co-Facilitators are at their leisure to produce informal notes, and that these have no status.
Significant divergence in opinion remained on whether to call for intersessional submissions and to mandate a synthesis report by the Secretariat thereon, with the EU, the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), the US, and AUSTRALIA supporting, and the ARAB GROUP, and LMDCs against.
Several parties expressed their disappointment with the manner in which negotiations had been conducted. The AFRICAN GROUP expressed “concerns, confusion, and uncertainty” on the process, and shared that the group felt “as though we are negotiating both with the Co-Facilitators and parties.” PAKISTAN considered that “the feeling of neutrality by the Co-Facilitators” was lacking. Several parties responded that they considered the Co-Facilitators’ work excellent and well within their mandate.
Parties were unable to come to an agreement on the draft conclusions. The Co-Facilitators will consult with the SB Chairs on a way forward.
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway), parties discussed revised draft conclusions, noting the Co-Facilitators succeeded in capturing progress made at the session.
Delegates continued debating how to clarify that until a determination is made in relation to emission avoidance, such activities would not be eligible under Article 6.2. Several parties considered that the current guidance on internationally transferred mitigation outcomes is sufficiently clear, while the EU and the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS (CfRN) requested more clarity, considering the magnitude of the environmental integrity risk. GRUPO SUR emphasized the need for consistency between references to this issue under both Article 6.2 and Article 6.4. 
After a huddle, parties reported convergence on the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) noting that: in the absence of further guidance by the CMA, the current guidance applies; and that emission avoidance is not included in the current guidance.
Delegates could not resolve disagreement over whether to conduct an intersessional workshop and what its format would be, with the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), LDCs, AILAC, and the AFRICAN GROUP calling for it to be hybrid. 
LMDCs and the ARAB GROUP said the entire draft conclusions text needs to remain bracketed until balanced progress is achieved across agenda items.
The Co-Facilitators will consult the SBSTA Chair on the way forward.
Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan), parties shared views on revised draft conclusions text. 
Discussions centered on language around emission avoidance and conservation enhancement. Parties agreed on the substance, but debated language, especially to acknowledge that conservation enhancement activities could result in reductions or removals. They converged on the SBSTA noting that: in the absence of further guidance by the CMA, the current Article 6.4 rules, modalities, and procedures (RMPs) apply; emission avoidance is not included; and conservation enhancement is not a separate category of activities in the current RMPs.
Parties refrained from restating their positions on a possible intersessional workshop, pointing to discussions held in informal consultations on Article 6.2. LMDCs underscored the entire draft conclusions text needs to remain bracketed until balanced progress is achieved across agenda items.
The Co-Facilitators will consult the SBSTA Chair on the way forward.
Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.8: In a contact group, Co-Chairs Jacqui Ruesga (New Zealand) and Kristin Qui (Trinidad and Tobago) invited views on revised draft conclusions text. CfRN welcomed the US and EU’s suggestion to request the Secretariat to add links to the Climate Technology Centre and Network and the Paris Committee on Capacity-building on the web-based platform for non-market approaches (NMAs), in recognition of their potential to provide technical and capacity-building support for identifying and developing NMAs.
After a lengthy huddle, parties reported agreement on outstanding issues related to, among others:
replacing a bracketed reference to recognizing that NMAs are “a key” or “an important” element of Paris Agreement implementation with a reference to the GST outcome on the urgent need to strengthen integrated, holistic, and balanced NMAs;
having a broad reference to capacity building, not just related to national Article 6.8 focal points;
deleting the invitation for parties to reflect on the importance of the provision of public finance from developed countries for NMAs as part of their consideration of the new collective quantified goal on climate finance; and
deleting the reference to launching a high-level ministerial event.
The Co-Chairs will revise the draft conclusions accordingly and forward them for adoption in the SB closing plenary.
Nairobi Work Programme on Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation to Climate Change: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Morgan Whalen (Canada), parties agreed to forward the revised draft conclusions text for adoption at the SB’s closing plenary.
Workshop under the Dialogue on Paris Agreement Article 2.1c: This mandated event focused on adaptation investments and the consistency of financial flows with a climate-resilient development pathway. Discussions related to, among others:
what signals need to be sent to public and private sector stakeholders outside the UNFCCC process;
capacity-building needs for project development and available support through the Green Climate Fund’s Readiness Programme;
cooperation among banks, such as through the Network for Greening the Financial System; and
insurers’ willingness to provide financing, such as debt instruments, when backed with some sort of security.
Breakout group discussions highlighted the need to reflect community and ecosystem aspects in the definition of resilience. Participants also noted the importance of attractive regulatory environments to encourage private sector engagement, and emphasized that climate-risk-informed approaches should not drive up the cost of capital for countries perceived as high-risk.
Just Transition Work Programme: In the morning, Contact Group Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) noted that, given that no agreement could be reached, the Co-Chairs would be forced to draft procedural conclusions. The AFRICAN GROUP requested additional time for informal consultations. Parties deliberated at length, but were unable to come to an agreement, and the session was suspended.
Parties reconvened in the early evening. Contact group Co-Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) requested a report of whether any agreement had been found between parties. Hearing none, she stated that the contact group had run out of time, and that the Co-Chairs would forward draft procedural conclusions to the SB Chairs. On a point of order, the G-77/CHINA noted that it could not agree to procedural conclusions and would need to consult.
The SB Chairs conducted further consultations later in the evening.
Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures under the Convention, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement: In contact group discussions co-chaired by Xolisa Ngwadla (Botswana), parties debated whether to use the updated draft conclusions text as basis for negotiations in Baku.
The EU, UK, US, CANADA, and SWITZERLAND objected to using the new text, noting the new table of activities failed to reflect parties’ submissions, with SWITZERLAND calling the text “unreadable and unacceptable,” and the EU and UK noting that the previous table better reflected parties’ proposals. 
Despite lengthy discussions in a huddle and two sessions of informal consultations, parties could not reach agreement during the afternoon. The Co-Chairs said they would consult with the SB Chairs on the way forward. Informal consultations continued in the evening. 
Research and Systematic Observation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Frank McGovern (Ireland) and Patricia Nying’uro (Kenya), parties reflected on revised draft conclusions, which include a placeholder for references to the 16th meeting of the research dialogue, research needs, and follow-up activities to the scientific community’s response to these needs.
AOSIS, the EU, US, and others, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and KUWAIT, called for inviting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to take into account, in determining its future products and assessment cycles, work under the Convention and the Paris Agreement.
 Parties then turned to the placeholder elements. AOSIS, the AFRICAN GROUP, EU, GRUPO SUR, CHILE, the UK, and US, supported by LDCs, JAPAN, and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, made textual proposals on these issues and called for projecting text on screen to facilitate deliberations thereon. SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, and INDIA opposed. After a lengthy debate on the process, discussions continued in informal informals.
Despite discussion in informal informals in the afternoon, parties did not reach an agreement on outstanding issues. AOSIS, supported by the EU, AFRICAN GROUP, LDCs, GRUPO SUR, and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, proposed a paragraph, in lieu of placeholder reference, that intends to capture research needs, acknowledge work that has been done, and recognize what further work needs to be finished.
With respect to referencing the IPCC, SAUDI ARABIA, with KUWAIT and INDIA, proposed to recognize the IPCC’s significant work in providing relevant information to parties on scientific, technical, and socio-economic aspects of climate change. After a lengthy debate, the proposed paragraphs from AOSIS and SAUDI ARABIA were placed in brackets.
With parties unable to reach agreement on the way forward, the Co-Facilitators will report back to the SBSTA Chair on the status of the negotiations.
Annual Dialogue on Ocean and Climate Change: On the second day of this mandated event, speakers presented case studies, best practices, and challenges related to ocean and climate action at the regional and national level. This was followed by interactive breakout sessions and a final wrap-up in plenary. Speakers and participants highlighted:
mangrove restoration and nature-based seawalls, which protect against erosion, sequester carbon, and serve as habitat for many species;
the need to scale up options to implement ocean-based renewable energy and decarbonize the maritime industry;
the role of Indigenous Peoples and coastal communities, and the need to protect their rights by implementing free, prior, and informed consent; and
the importance of viewing the ocean as intrinsically valuable, not only as a solution to climate change.
In the Corridors
For most delegates, if the word of the day was “huddle,” the second word was “time”—as in, “dear Co-Facilitators, if we could have just a bit more time to consult, maybe in a huddle…” 
Indeed, negotiators who had complained that certain rooms were too large to interact intimately got a taste of their own medicine when, in a last-minute rush to avoid procedural conclusions, they begged for time to gather and hash out bridging proposals. Clumps of negotiators formed—sometimes multiple huddles in the same room, leading one Co-Chair to try to herd parties, reminding them that they are supposed to talk “to each other, not around each other.”
With the final plenary less than twenty-four hours away, applause went up in every room that managed to agree on draft conclusions. Some grimly accepted the results regardless of the actual quality of the text—one negotiator was overheard mentioning that the draft conclusions of his item were akin to “putting lipstick on a pig.”
Still, other negotiators pointed out that it would have been much worse, both from the point of view of appearances and of substantial work, to arrive in Baku with nothing to show from Bonn. And a hardy few remained stubbornly optimistic: “We have done all we can to set ourselves up for success in Baku, even if that just means capturing our discussions. We need every idea on the table in November—we’re going to need them!”
The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary and analysis of SB 60 will be available on Monday, 17 June 2024, here."
3,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-3jun2024,True,Daily report for 3 June 2024,"The joint opening plenary of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) had to be suspended twice, but overall the launch of the Bonn Climate Change Conference was fairly smooth. Parties adopted the provisional agendas and launched negotiations, including on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). Some mandated events took place before the negotiations even started. One was especially relevant, as it focused on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG) to be defined prior to 2025.
Opening Statements
Executive Secretary Simon Stiell opened the meeting by urging delegates to think of the work ahead as a feat of engineering: now that the design phase is complete, delegates “must put the machinery to work fully and fairly,” with every part working together coherently.
Finance is the “great enabler of climate action,” he underlined, urging progress towards the NCQG. He stressed that new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) must close the implementation gap and be aligned with the 1.5°C goal. With regard to the first biennial transparency reports (BTRs), due in 2024, he stressed that “perfection must not be the enemy of the good” and pointed to collaboration across the UN system and with other partners to support parties in preparing their reports. Finally, he noted parties’ financial contributions have not increased to match the Secretariat’s growing mandates.
During Stiell’s opening address, two civil society activists walked on stage for a silent protest, holding a Palestinian flag and a sign denouncing “business as usual under genocide.” SBSTA Chair Harry Vreuls suspended the session and requested they be escorted from the premises by UN Security.
Delegates observed a moment of silence in tribute to Daniel Machado da Fonseca, a long-time Brazilian negotiator who passed away in 2024.
Uganda, for G-77/CHINA, welcomed pledges to the new loss and damage fund, and argued that all COP 28 outcomes must be implemented to meet the urgent need for action. He outlined a number of priorities, including: adopting an ambitious NCQG; operationalizing the outcomes of the Global Stocktake (GST) and decisions on loss and damage; and scaling up support for mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage.
The EUROPEAN UNION stressed that the NCQG is a unique opportunity to scale up adaptation funding. He emphasized that the goal should be fit for purpose and that public resources will not suffice to meet needs. He invited parties to make their updated NDCs economy-wide, with absolute reduction targets, energy transition goals, and respecting the 1.5°C goal.
Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, underlined the need for long-term pathways to be built into NDCs, and proposed convening a high-level meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly, for parties to compare notes and ensure sufficiently ambitious NDCs.
Canada, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, urged countries to put forward NDCs that are aligned with achieving 1.5°C in order to send out a clear signal to spur investments. She emphasized the importance of mobilizing public and private finance to enable climate action and called for progress on adaptation indicators, the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, and the Gender Action Plan.
Samoa, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), highlighted that the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea recently issued an advisory opinion that states have a major obligation to monitor emissions to prevent marine pollution. She emphasized the need to phase out fossil fuels and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. She called for transformative and 1.5°C aligned NDCs, and urged financial and technical support for small island states to prepare their BTRs.
Kenya, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for an ambitious NCQG, implementing the outcome of the first GST, and swiftly operationalizing the loss and damage fund. He also lamented the decision to host the secretariat of the Santiago Network in a developed country despite the recommendation to host it in Nairobi, Kenya.
Bolivia, for LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), highlighted the importance of multilateralism but lamented that “goalposts are being shifted,” mandates selectively viewed, and the responsibility to act devolved to developing countries. He urged that parties enhance their level of ambition, with developed countries reaching net zero by 2030 and net negative shortly thereafter.
Brazil, for BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, and CHINA (BASIC), urged parties to exercise mutual solidarity to achieve the long-term goals of the Convention and Paris Agreement. He called for clarity on the definition of climate finance in order to ensure transparency and accountability, and urged developed countries to close the implementation gap and not transfer the burden of action to developing countries.
Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, called for a new and ambitious model of finance based on developing country needs and developed country responsibilities. He underlined that the GST must be viewed holistically with consideration for countries’ different circumstances and approaches, and stressed that the mitigation work programme should be a space to exchange experiences and best practices.
Malawi, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), underscored the importance of financial support for NDC implementation. He urged progress on the GGA and called for fully operationalizing the new loss and damage fund by COP 29. He also called for resolving issues related to the timely provision of visas, which affected several LDC negotiators.
Venezuela, for the BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA (ALBA), underscored that developed countries must take the lead in implementing the outcome of the GST. She said the GST outcome cannot be used as a basis for conditioning developing countries’ access to finance, technology, or capacity-building support.
Argentina, for GRUPO SUR, highlighted that the NCQG will define ambition for years to come and urged for more rapid progress in the negotiations. She called for a clear definition of climate finance, accounting for common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). She urged timely support for BTR preparation.
Honduras, for the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), highlighted the need to: ensure alignment of NDCs with the calls contained in the GST outcome, follow up on the implementation of the GST, and discuss means of implementation to respond to the GST’s calls. She also called for the mitigation work programme to live up to its mandate and for support and action on loss and damage.
Honduras, for the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS, emphasized the importance of sustainable forest management and reforestation and, urging for the upholding of environmental integrity, cautioned that net-zero activities must be in line with the Paris Agreement.
The CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMISSION FOR ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT FROM THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM expressed concern about adverse hydrometeorological events in the region that limit national capacities to achieve national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and NDCs. She called on developed countries to provide means of implementation and urged all countries, especially large emitters, to review their NDC commitments to ensure they cover all sectors and GHGs.
The INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) outlined ongoing work in its 7th assessment cycle, including a special report on climate change and cities, and a methodology report on short-lived climate forcers. He encouraged the nomination of female scientists and early career scientists as chapter authors.
The WORLD CLIMATE RESEARCH PROGRAMME (WCRP) outlined ongoing work on regional climate downscaling and providing societally-relevant climate information for regions.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) highlighted the Early Warnings for All initiative and outlined plans to integrate these efforts into the UNFCCC agenda.
The GLOBAL CLIMATE OBSERVING SYSTEM underlined that the organization has been keeping pace with evolving monitoring needs and expressed readiness to respond to further requests to assess the state of the climate and to close observation gaps.
The INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION (IMO) pointed to the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, which contains pathways for the shipping sector to reach net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050. He outlined work on transposing this strategy to mandatory requirements for ships under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).
The INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION (ICAO) outlined two major milestones: adoption in 2022 of a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net zero by 2050; and adoption in 2023 of a Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels, Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels, and other Aviation Cleaner Energies. She highlighted the goal to reduce international aviation’s CO2 emissions by 5% through the use of these fuels.
BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY NGOs called for ambitious NDCs aligned with the 1.5°C goal and mobilizing finance to create an ambitious and achievable NCQG, and highlighted the essential role of the private sector in achieving the goals of the Convention.
CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK criticized the “incremental, untenable, business-as-usual approach” of the process and called for an exponential increase in low-cost public finance for adaptation.
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO DEMAND CLIMATE JUSTICE highlighted that the struggles for human rights and for climate justice are inextricably linked.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ ORGANIZATIONS called for criteria for just transition to include Indigenous Peoples’ rights and environmental safeguards.
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES highlighted the importance of collaboration with actors across sectors and governmental levels, and expressed concern about the Secretariat’s limited budget.
RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NGOs argued that climate-vulnerable communities must be given decision-making power in accessing funds and emphasized the need for equitable transition.
TRADE UNION NGOs stressed that the just transition work programme and parties’ NDCs must address labor rights.
WOMEN AND GENDER advocated that the NCQG must scale up public financial support to developing countries in a manner that is adequate, predictable, human rights-centered, and gender-transformative.
YOUTH NGOs called on parties to acknowledge the differentiated needs of children, improve accessibility and transparency in the process, and address fair burden-sharing in the NCQG.
Procedural Matters
Adoption of the Agendas: At the outset, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION objected to the adoption of the agendas on the basis that four of its negotiators had not been provided with visas by the host country. After a short suspension, the delegation withdrew its objection, reserving the right to block the adoption of outcomes should the visa matter not be resolved. Later in the day, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION reported the outstanding visas had been granted.
SBI Chair Nabeel Munir and SBSTA Chair Vreuls pointed to constructive pre-sessional consultations with groups and parties on the agendas. Parties agreed to adopt the provisional agendas (FCCC/SBI/2024/4 and FCCC/SBSTA/2024/4) without the items proposed for inclusion by Bolivia, on developed countries’ immediate and urgent action to achieve net-zero emissions at the latest by 2030 and net-negative emissions thereafter, and on means of implementation for alternative policy approaches to results-based payments. The SB Chairs will hold consultations on these two matters and report back at the closing plenary.
Bolivia, for LMDCs, called out the failure of Global North countries to fulfill their obligations, highlighting that developed countries’ net-zero emissions targets fall short of what is required to address the climate crisis and lamented the onset of “carbon colonialism.” He invited the Troika of COP Presidencies to work on developing a roadmap to facilitate non-market approaches to mitigation and adaptation.
Kenya, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for two separate agenda items on the report of the Adaptation Committee and the review of the progress, effectiveness, and performance of the Committee, respectively, rather than subsuming them under one item. SBSTA Chair Vreuls confirmed that there will be separate items for these matters at future sessions.
Organization of Work: Contact groups will convene on:
the just transition work programme;
matters relating to the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures;
the framework for non-market approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.8;
arrangements for intergovernmental meetings; and
administrative, financial and institutional matters.
Informal consultations will convene on all other agenda items included in the adopted agendas.
On reporting from and review of Annex I parties, Brazil, for BASIC, supported by EGYPT and BOLIVIA, expressed concern at the compilation and synthesis of Annex I parties’ biennial reports, noting projected increases in Annex I parties’ greenhouse gas emissions from 2020-2030. He requested dedicated time and space to consider this agenda item, including the synthesis report. The SBI Chair confirmed that each item under this agenda item will be considered separately.
Election of Officers: Pending the outcome of consultations, the current SBI and SBSTA Vice-Chairs and Rapporteurs will remain in office.
Mandated Events: The SB Chairs noted an unprecedented 30 mandated events will take place during the meeting, including the multilateral assessment and facilitative sharing of views.
Negotiations and Mandated Events
Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Pedro Pedroso Cuesta (Cuba) and Tina Kobilšek (Slovenia), parties shared views on the modalities of the work programme on GGA indicators.
The G-77/CHINA emphasized the urgency and importance of finalizing the roadmap for the work programme, but cautioned against increasing developing countries’ reporting burden.
AOSIS, supported by LDCs, AILAC, and BRAZIL, proposed that the SB Chairs convene and oversee an expert working group, balanced in terms of geographical representation and expertise, to work on mapping and developing indicators. AILAC suggested the Adaptation Committee assist with the initial mapping of existing indicators. CANADA, the US, JAPAN, CHINA, and NORWAY said the Adaptation Committee should take the lead on mapping the indicators, while experts can provide input and identify gaps.
Parties discussed holding workshops for the development of the indicators, with differing views as to the number of workshops to be held. CANADA and JAPAN requested that the Secretariat provide budgetary estimates for the conduct of such workshops. AILAC, supported by CHAD, CANADA, the UK, and the US, called for including Indigenous Peoples in indicator development.
Parties mandated the Co-Facilitators to prepare a draft decision text.
Tenth Technical Expert Dialogue under the Ad Hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: Panel discussions focused on the goal’s level of ambition, qualitative elements, structure, and transparency arrangements. Participants shared a host of reflections, challenging one another’s positions on, among others:
using structure to address matters of importance to different parties, such as sources of finance;
developed countries’ contribution to the core of the goal;
adjusting the quantum of the goal according to the evolving needs of developing countries;
correlations between levels of development and enabling environments;
safeguards meant to address the risk of corruption becoming a disproportionate barrier to access;
the role of the Enhanced Transparency Framework, Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows, and the GST process with regard to transparency on the goal; and
suitable timing for a meaningful review of NCQG implementation, considering data lags.
Cooperation with other International Organizations: During its opening plenary, the SBSTA noted the report (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/Inf.1).
In the Corridors
The banks of the Rhine were worryingly high as delegates came ashore at the World Conference Center on Monday—and waters got rough in the plenary hall too.
Twice, the Chairs of the Subsidiary Bodies were forced to suspend the opening of the meeting. Firstly as two civil society delegates took to the stage during the Executive Secretary’s opening remarks. UN security quickly surrounded them, as they silently held up a Palestinian flag and message of protest. Some delegates appreciated Chair Vreuls’ “firm but fair” approach to removing the protesters. Others reserved their judgment, waiting to see whether the protesters would be allowed back into the venue to follow the remainder of the meeting.
Then, as the meeting agendas were presented for adoption, Russia firmly objected to moving forward as long as four of its negotiators’ visas were held up by the German authorities. The subsequent waves were sufficient to get things moving, both for the Russian delegation and the process. “I wonder if this means that Germany will also reconsider the other visas they denied,” shared one observer, referring to the fact that several negotiators from least developed countries—including one head of delegation—have been prevented from attending due to visa issues.
 “All in all, this was not too bad,” summed up a seasoned delegate. “Considering where geopolitics and climate impacts have brought the world, we need more trust and compassion between parties,” countered another. “We need to do what is necessary, not the bare minimum.”"
4,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-4jun2024,True,Daily report for 4 June 2024,"Negotiations launched on issues such as the refinement of the Paris Agreement’s Global Stocktake (GST) process, the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), and cooperative implementation of the Paris Agreement (Article 6). A dialogue focused on the disproportionate effects of climate change on children and delegates also continued reflecting on the gender action plan.
Negotiations and Mandated Events
Procedural and Logistical Elements of the Overall Global Stocktake Process: Co-Facilitator Patrick Spicer (Canada) opened the informal consultations by inviting views on how to refine the procedural and logistical elements of the GST process based on the experiences of the first GST, with a view to adopt a decision thereon in Baku.
Points of consensus emerged around, inter alia:
aligning the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s seventh assessment cycle with the second GST to include the best available science;
considering outputs earlier in the process;
achieving regionally balanced representation in the second GST’s high-level committee; and
achieving a balance between future-oriented and backward-looking assessments of collective progress.
The Co-Facilitators will produce draft text.
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize), discussions focused on what should be included in draft decision text to be forwarded to SBSTA 61 and CMA 6. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), supported by the EUROPEAN UNION (EU), ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), REPUBLIC OF KOREA, JAPAN, and others called for the decision to reflect and build on the outcome of the GST on mitigation. Several parties pointed to paragraph 186 of the GST outcome decision, which invites relevant work programmes to integrate relevant GST outcomes in planning their future work. The LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs) noted this paragraph contains the caveat “in line with their mandates” and said such integration is not in line with the work programme mandate, and, together with INDIA and the ARAB GROUP, opposed reflecting the GST outcome in the decision text.
Additional elements proposed for the decision text included substantive actions to scale up mitigation ambition, and calls for submitting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in line with 1.5°C and covering all greenhouse gases and sectors. Parties also provided feedback on the global dialogues, proposing process improvements to logistics and participation, as well as the possibility of organizing regional dialogues. Parties also called for the dialogues to be translated to real, implementable action that can help parties scale up mitigation action and ambition.
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) introduced an informal note produced by the SBSTA Chair. They explained the group’s mandate is to develop draft decision text for consideration in Baku and focus on “crunch issues” including authorizations, registries, the Agreed Electronic Format (AEF), and sequencing.
Most parties supported the proposed mode of work. A few noted they were not consulted in the preparation of the informal note and opposed using it as a basis for discussions. The LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs) underlined there was convergence on most issues during COP 28, but that no decision was adopted because parties wanted a package decision. He urged not reopening everything and focusing only on crunch issues. The EIG expressed dissatisfaction with the text on changes to authorizations and revocations but stated willingness to work on the text. The COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS (CfRN) and AILAC called for definition of cooperative approaches and AOSIS highlighted inclusion of common nomenclatures. The UK identified changes and minimum authorization elements and infrastructure, including the AEF.
The Co-Facilitators invited written inputs from parties to inform the development of draft text.
Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: During informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) introduced an informal note produced by the SBSTA Chair. They explained the group’s mandate is to address outstanding divergences, and develop draft decision text for consideration at SBSTA 61 and CMA 6. They also invited written inputs from parties for use in developing a first iteration of text, and proposed focusing on authorizations and issues relating to registries.
Several parties welcomed the informal note as a good starting point, while highlighting that it does not represent consensus. Others opposed, noting they were not consulted in the preparation of the text and would not be willing to “legitimize” the text in this manner.
Most parties agreed that the two suggested topics are key issues. Regarding authorizations, parties expressed diverging views on the sequencing of authorization and on whether mitigation outcomes had to be authorized before issuance or could simply be authorized before first transfer. In addition, the AFRICAN GROUP suggested that the methodologies and removals recommendation should be finalized. BRAZIL proposed rules for the transition of afforestation and reforestation activities from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to the Article 6.4 mechanism.
Glasgow Committee on Non-Market Approaches: In a contact group co-chaired by Jacqui Ruesga (New Zealand), the Secretariat provided an update on the development of the web-based platform and highlighted upcoming outreach on how to publish non-market approaches (NMAs) on the platform.
Regarding themes for spin-off groups at SB 60, the EU, opposed by the CfRN, the ARAB GROUP, LMDCs, BRAZIL, and INDIA, proposed carbon pricing and nature-based solutions. The EU clarified that carbon pricing discussions would exclude carbon markets and said nature-based solutions are not a market approach. The US supported considering whether carbon pricing and other economic instruments that do not result in a transfer of mitigation outcomes would be appropriate in the context of the NMA framework. CANADA suggested non-market-based pricing approaches. TUVALU supported discussing the non-market elements of carbon pricing, such as feed-in tariffs, and nature-based solutions.
Several parties suggested addressing challenges in identifying and implementing NMAs, and in using the web-based platform. Other suggestions related to, among others: NMAs’ contribution to NDC achievement and sustainable development, mobilizing finance for local adaptation, linkages with biodiversity considerations, and sustainable forest management.
Report of the Adaptation Committee and Review of the Progress, Effectiveness, and Performance of the Committee: In informal consultations, SBI Chair Nabeel Munir invited parties’ comments on the draft conclusions prepared by the SB Chairs, which propose to: recommend COP 29/CMA 6 take note of the 2023 report of the Adaptation Committee (AC) for 2023; continue considering the review of the progress, effectiveness, and performance of the AC at SB 62; and consider the annual report of the AC and the performance review of the AC as two separate sub-agenda items at future sessions.
The US and the EU agreed that there should be two separate agenda sub-items, but disagreed on deferring the performance review to SB 62, arguing that it makes sense to address both agenda sub-items at the same time. SAUDI ARABIA clarified that review of the AC report is done only every 5 years.
Parties agreed on the draft conclusions.
Terms of Reference for the 2024 Review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts: In informal consultations, parties supported Co-Facilitator Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu)’s proposal to use the terms of reference for the 2019 WIM review as basis for discussions.
EIG called out the lack of progress with regard to the work of the WIM Executive Committee (WIM ExCom) in Eastern Europe. The LDCs called for reflecting on the status of financial support for the WIM ExCom and the Santiago Network to deliver on their mandates. AILAC recommended conducting a survey on the WIM ExCom’s progress and effectiveness.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare an elements paper, to be informed by these discussions and additional written submissions.
Just Transition Work Programme: Marianne Karlsen (Norway) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) co-chaired contract group discussions.
Parties outlined perceived areas of agreement that emerged during the first dialogue under the work programme, which took place on 2-3 June 2024. These included: tailoring just transition actions to local contexts and national circumstances; building on a whole-of-government approach; and aligning with Paris Agreement goals while including the rights of workers, Indigenous Peoples, and other vulnerable groups.
LMDCs, CHINA, and VENEZUELA stressed that the impact of “unilateral trade measures” on just transitions should be addressed under the work programme. The US argued the World Trade Organization would be a more appropriate forum for discussing this issue.
LDCs, the ARAB GROUP, the US, and others called for more direct interaction in future dialogues, and recommended a “world café” approach. CANADA and others argued for better inclusion of observers in future dialogues.
The Co-Chairs will produce a draft text.
Linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism: This mandated event convened throughout the day. On what the Financial Mechanism can do to enhance support for the implementation of the outcomes of the technology needs assessments (TNA) process and Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) technical assistance, ideas included:
streamlining the process of converting these outcomes into bankable projects and enhancing efficiencies through a “plug and play” approach;
implementing strategies to enable National Designated Authorities to plan ahead and implement multi-year programmes rather than operating on a project-by-project basis; and
allocating adequate funds to support implementation of the TNAs and CTCN technical assistance outcomes.
On actions that the Technology Mechanism can undertake, participants called for: enhanced partnerships with accredited entities and direct access entities; better promotion of TNAs; and tailored support mechanisms that address specific needs of countries.
Joint Work on Implementation of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food Security: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Una May Gordon (Belize) recalled that parties agreed to continue the discussion on the operationalization of the joint work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security, taking into consideration the informal note from SB 59.
Parties unanimously agreed there was no time to waste to launch work, with several suggesting focused discussions on workshop topics, synthesis reports, and the online portal. Discussions continued in informal informals in the afternoon.
In-Session Workshop on Progress, Challenges, Gaps, and Priorities in Implementing the Gender Action Plan and on Future Work to be Undertaken on Gender and Climate Change: This was the second day of the three-day-long mandated event. Discussions touched upon, inter alia:
the pervasive “siloing” of gender within programmes;
moving from creating plans to ensuring implementation;
gender-disaggregated data;
capturing the “diverse realities of people” by adopting an intersectional lens across the action plan; and
enhancing linkages and complementarities with processes such as those related to the new collective quantified goal on climate finance and the Global Goal on Adaptation.
Expert Dialogue on Children and Climate Change: This mandated event convened throughout the day. The first part focused on the disproportionate impacts of climate change on children, including with regard to: physical and mental health; access to essential services such as food, water, and sanitation; the disruption of education; and cultural impacts.
Participants reflected on the various ways in which climate change jeopardizes children’s right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. They pointed to increases in the number of miscarriages and premature births, higher child mortality, and compromised access to prenatal care and pediatric health service, among others.
The second part focused on solutions. Several speakers emphasized the need to provide a space for children to express themselves, with one panelist noting youth engagement enhances the effectiveness of climate solutions. Colombian youth climate activist Francisco Vera called for a children’s COP focused on their wellbeing.
In a world café session on enablers of change, participants suggested:
including children in national delegations and in the work of constituted bodies;
creating an accessible space for children to understand the process and engage with policymakers; and
bearing children’s interests in mind when developing climate policies.
Arrangements for Intergovernmental Meetings: SBI Chair Munir chaired contact group discussions, inviting views on, among others, the organization of COP 29, including the provisional agendas; and the potential hosts of COP 31, COP 32, and COP 33 (FCCC/SBI/2024/8).
The EU, EIG, the US, CANADA, and NORWAY called for language on ensuring human rights are upheld, per SBI 58 conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2023/L.10). The COP 29 Presidency highlighted staff training on the code of conduct and the creation of a dedicated protest zone. Responding to the AFRICAN GROUP, the Presidency pointed to direct outreach on visa issuance, and assured CHINA that the large number of gates at the venue should curtail waiting times.
Regarding the provisional CMA 6 agenda, the EU, EIG, US, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, and NORWAY called for the dialogue on implementing the outcomes of the GST to be considered under matters related to the GST, rather than matters related to finance. The AFRICAN GROUP, ARAB GROUP, BRAZIL, and CHINA opposed the suggested change, underscoring the paragraph establishing the dialogue is contained in the GST outcome’s section on finance. The EIG pointed to ongoing discussions on the dialogue’s scope.
The US suggested removing the item on the dialogue on Paris Agreement 2.1c, and, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, on the report on doubling adaptation finance.
Calls for additional items related to:
considering the report from the annual dialogue on how the GST informs the preparation of NDCs, suggested by EIG and the US;
considering the seventh review of the Financial Mechanism under both the COP and CMA, proposed by the US; and
an item on the special needs and circumstances of Africa, put forward by the AFRICAN GROUP.
Regional groups reported that consultations are underway on the hosts of future COPs. The WESTERN EUROPEAN AND OTHERS GROUP indicated they hope to reach agreement on a regional nomination in time for COP 29, with AUSTRALIA and TÜRKIYE reiterating their candidacy.
In the Corridors
When delegates came to the venue on Tuesday, some appeared to have a severe case of the Mondays. Contact group discussions were slow to warm up, with one Co-Chair threatening to start singing in the absence of interventions. Changes inside the venue, likely spurred by lack of funds, meant that seasoned delegates’ well-worn habits were thrown into chaos. There were longer waiting lines at the venue entrance in the morning; the ever-useful coffee spot in front of Chamber Hall had disappeared, leading to some caffeine deprivation. “None of us has gotten into the rhythm yet. It’s time to be done with the preliminaries and get going on what’s important,” assessed one experienced observer.
Still, one participant thought that delegates would shake off the cobwebs soon enough. “Discussions on the NCQG haven’t started yet—I bet we’ll be a lot more vocal when we start talking money,” they opined. Another pointed to the usual fault lines around finance that emerged in discussions on the agendas of the next meeting in Baku. “Nothing like finding a few red lines to focus the mind,” he quipped."
5,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-5jun2024,True,Daily report for 5 June 2024,"Negotiations convened throughout the day, addressing issues such as the cooperative implementation of the Paris Agreement (Article 6) and how to cope with the increasing number of issues to be addressed in the climate negotiations. Delegates also discussed the new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG).
Negotiations
Modalities of the Dialogue on Implementing the Global Stocktake Outcomes: Ricardo Marshall (Barbados) and Patrick Spicer (Canada) opened the informal consultations by recalling the dialogue was established in the CMA 5 outcome on the first Global Stocktake (GST) and highlighted the aim to operationalize it at CMA 6.
The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), EU, ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), the US, NORWAY, JAPAN, and others argued that the scope of the dialogue should consider all aspects of the GST outcome. The AFRICAN GROUP, LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), SOUTH AFRICA, and CHINA argued that the paragraph establishing the dialogue was contained in the section on means of implementation, specifically finance, and that the dialogue should focus on finance.
The EIG proposed that the Secretariat produce a report by 2025 on global progress on all GST calls to action. The US suggested that the dialogue takes place at a high level.
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand), parties expressed their views on the way forward for the work programme and specifically on whether or not to prepare draft decision text for consideration by CMA 6. Most parties supported this and proposed elements for inclusion in such a text.
AOSIS underlined that the mitigation work programme (MWP) should play a more substantive role in helping unlock transformation in all sectors and, with JAPAN, called for including headline mitigation messages from the GST outcome. The US suggested an overarching message reflecting urgency of action and guidance for future work of the MWP. Most parties also supported reflecting key messages and recommendations from the global dialogues and investment-focused events.
The LMDCs preferred an exchange of views and reflections on the recently-concluded third global dialogue under the MWP and, with the ARAB GROUP, opposed preparation of decision text. The ARAB GROUP said that rather than inscribe diverging views in draft text, these should be discussed in the informal consultations.
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway), discussions focused on the “authorizations” elements of the text. Parties expressed diverging views on the types, format, and content of authorizations, as well as on the permissibility of revoking authorizations, whether before or after first issuance of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). While some parties asserted the need to authorize each cooperative approach and ITMOs, others stated the rules only require authorizations of ITMOs and a general authorization to participate in the Article 6.2 cooperative approaches.
On revocation, the EIG, AOSIS, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND and others opposed language in the draft text allowing changes in authorization of ITMOs whether before or after first issuance. The AFRICAN GROUP, LDCs, LMDCs, CHINA, GRUPO SUR, and others highlighted changes in authorization as a national prerogative, and stated that provided participating parties agree, it should be permitted before first issuance. Parties also called for a clear definition of what “extreme circumstances” would be grounds for changes in authorizations as specified in the draft text.
Parties also considered the format of authorizations, with the UK, LDCs, CANADA, and others supporting minimum mandatory requirements for authorizations of ITMOs. LMDCs, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, and others, however, noted authorizations are part of initial reports and that the existing guidance for initial reporting is sufficient for authorizations.
In the afternoon, parties focused on matters relating to registries. The main point of debate was the extent of the interoperability of parties’ national registries and connection between the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the international registry. Several parties, including the EU, AOSIS, AFRICAN GROUP and others, expressed satisfaction with the current text that permits transfers of authorized Article 6.4 emission reductions, being ITMOs, from the mechanism to the international registry. AOSIS and the AFRICAN GROUP clarified that many of their members will rely on the international registry and therefore need this functionality, as they do not have the capacity to establish national registries. The LMDCs and ARAB GROUP opposed the text, stating the connection should be limited to the ability to pull and view data and information on Article 6.4 emission reductions.
Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan), parties continued sharing views on the informal note prepared by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).
On authorizations, the EIG, AOSIS, UK, AUSTRALIA and others proposed deleting language specifying that if no statement has been provided at the time of issuance, the mechanism registry administrator shall assign the mitigation contributions. They underlined mitigation contributions can only be issued after authorization by the host country. The AFRICAN GROUP, LMDCs, ARAB GROUP, BRAZIL, INDIA and others opposed deletion, saying authorization can be provided at or after issuance, and that the quality and stringency of units remain the same regardless of authorization or lack of it.
On the mechanism registry, most parties supported the current text that refers to the interoperability of the mechanism registry and parties’ national registries. The AFRICAN GROUP further noted that some countries that do not have national registries intend to use the international registry, and highlighted linkages. The LMDCs and ARAB GROUP proposed text stating there will be no transfer of Article 6.4 emission reductions from the mechanism registry to the international registry or national registries.
Most parties preferred to conclude, at this session, the consideration of whether the Article 6.4 mechanism can include emission avoidance and conservation enhancement activities. They suggested agreeing that Article 6.4 will not include such activities. Others expressed willingness to defer consideration to 2028, as provided in the note.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare draft text.
Second Meeting under the Ad Hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: Work programme Co-Chairs Zaheer Fakir (UAE) and Fiona Gilbert (Australia) invited views on an input paper they prepared building on the first meeting of the work programme. From the outset, parties provided the Co-Chairs a mandate to streamline their paper, which is currently 63 pages long.
With respect to substance, comments related to, among others:
ensuring the goal is fit for purpose and implementable, responsive to developing countries’ needs, and supports implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and national adaptation plans (NAPs), in line with 1.5°C;
aligning the NCQG with the NDC and GST cycles;
the recipient base possibly reflecting vulnerability, macroeconomic circumstances, and regional equity;
possible burden sharing among developed countries, to enhance transparency and accountability;
whether to address issues such as the contributor base and alignment of finance flows (Paris Article 2.1c); and
using tools such as a tax on defense companies or a financial transaction tax to mobilize funds.
The Co-Chairs will revise their text.
Just Transition Work Programme: Co-Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) introduced draft text and invited parties’ views. The G-77/CHINA and LMDCs argued that the draft text was not suitable for engagement, with the AFRICAN GROUP calling the text “completely unbalanced.”
Many parties requested additional details to be incorporated in subsequent drafts, including: NEW ZEALAND requesting details on the relevant outcomes of the GST; and AOSIS suggesting to reflect that just transition pathways should aim to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. The US called for a placeholder for key messages.
The EU, ARAB GROUP, GRUPO SUR, and CHINA argued that references to response measures were out of scope and should be removed. The US responded that several calls had been made by parties for response measures to be a cross-cutting issue.
Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures under the Convention, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement: Maria Samuelsen (Denmark) co-chaired contact group discussions. Parties shared views on an oral report by the Secretariat on progress in implementing the workplan of the Forum and its Katowice Committee of Experts, with a view to inform the development of a five-year workplan.
The US proposed deleting references to just transition in the workplan as it is already covered under a different agenda item. The G-77/CHINA opposed, stating that promotion of just transition is part of the mandate.
Research and Systematic Observation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Patricia Nyinguro (Kenya) and Frank McGovern (Ireland) invited comments on draft conclusions text.
AOSIS, supported by the EU, AFRICAN GROUP, LDCs, US, UK, GRENADA, and BOTSWANA, proposed including a paragraph that acknowledges the organization of the 16th meeting of the research dialogue and captures the discussions that occurred. The ARAB GROUP, KUWAIT, and CHINA opposed, stating that the organization and the topics of the dialogue did not reflect a party-driven process, lacked transparency and inclusivity, and did not provide sufficient time for parties to engage.
CHILE, supported by the UK, proposed language to call on the scientific community to respond to parties’ research needs, with AFRICAN GROUP proposing to establish a tracking mechanism to capture research needs and their fulfillment. GRUPO SUR, supported by AOSIS, raised concerns about the limited financial support for research and systematic observation on a global level.
Parties agreed to take note of the beginning of the IPCC’s seventh assessment cycle, recognizing its role in providing relevant scientific information.
Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Kajsa Fernström Naby (Sweden) invited comments on the Co-Facilitators’ draft text.
BRAZIL and BOLIVIA called for strengthening the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP) and mainstreaming its work in the UNFCCC process. BRAZIL lamented that language barriers prevent Indigenous Peoples and local communities from participating and asked the Secretariat to engage with the LCIPP on translating relevant information.
The EU proposed approving the LCIPP’s Facilitative Working Group’s work plan and to refrain from adding more activities, but BRAZIL welcomed further debate on the matter.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ORGANISATION (IPO) urged a clear distinction between Indigenous Peoples and local communities and their respective knowledge.
Discussions will continue in informal informals.
Arrangements for Intergovernmental Meetings: In a contact group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) Chair Nabeel Munir noted that both smaller delegations and the Secretariat are overstretched due to the increasing number of agenda items to be considered at meetings. The Secretariat presented reports on options for reducing overlapping items (FCCC/TP/2024/5) and the implications of changing meeting frequencies (FCCC/2024/INF.4).
The AFRICAN GROUP, supported by the EIG, argued that maintaining momentum in climate policy is essential. He warned that reducing participation or agenda items could hamper progress.
The EU suggested, inter alia, calling on the Bureau to define a manageable number of time slots for mandated events. With the EIG, he suggested taking into consideration support for agenda items before including them in provisional agendas and, with NORWAY, clustering similar agenda items under broader headings.
The EIG suggested exploring measures to reduce participant numbers by, for example: encouraging delegations to limit their numbers; funding only small delegations; or capping the number of official side events and exhibits. EGYPT warned that limiting participant numbers could limit discussion. He noted that the virtual platform can be essential to some participants.
In the Corridors
It’s never too early in the negotiations to look out for warning signs. So it was that on Wednesday afternoon, some newer delegates saw terrible portents in a daunting 63-page paper on the new finance goal. Yet not all signs are bad omens. Wiser, more seasoned negotiators reassured that this is a normal feature in an inclusive process where all parties’ views are captured to lay common ground. “We’ve given the Co-Facilitators a mandate to streamline the text—and doing that this early in the meeting is a good omen,” one commented. “No need to hide under the bed. Not for this, anyway.”
Elsewhere in the building, minute discussions were already underway on the just transition work programme. While some were optimistic about substantial work beginning, observers were quick to point out that those who will have to implement just transition—such as labor organizations, businesses, and financial institutions—had no real say. “We can’t afford to end up with a mammoth text that reflects parties’ views but can’t be put into practice,” they argued. “I hope negotiators can keep this in mind, but it’s too early to tell.” Those who emerged into the sunlit Bonn evening searched the heavens for a sign."
6,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-6jun2024,True,Daily report for 6 June 2024,"Negotiations continued on various issues on the meeting agendas, including refining the process for the Global Stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement. Delegates also continued discussions on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG) and how to ensure coordination between different institutions working on loss and damage.
Negotiations and Mandated Events
Procedural and Logistical Elements of the Overall Global Stocktake Process: Co-Facilitator Patrick Spicer (Canada) presented an informal note outlining potential categories of procedural and logistical refinements of the GST process. Co-Facilitator Thureya Al Ali (UAE) presented examples of potential procedural refinements, based on previous discussions, for the purpose of inviting views.
The G-77/CHINA expressed frustration that the document does not reflect the views his constituency had previously expressed. The EU, ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), GRUPO SUR, and the US considered the text a helpful basis upon which to make additional suggestions.
Parties made extensive technical suggestions. Points of concordance related to, among others, ensuring that: documents submitted to inform the Global Stocktake (GST) start with a summary of key points; information from the IPCC’s seventh assessment cycle can be considered; and there is more time to engage in negotiations over the output.
The Co-Facilitators will consolidate these views and submissions into a more detailed informal note.
Modalities of the Dialogue on Implementing the Global Stocktake Outcomes: Co-Facilitator Ricardo Marshall (Barbados) invited views on potential objectives for the dialogue.
The LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs) argued that the scope of the dialogue should be constrained to means of implementation and finance. The EU, EIG, LDCs, INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), the UK, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, and others demurred, highlighting that the dialogue needs to consider all aspects of the GST’s outcome rather than focus on a single one. MALAWI called for implementation of GST outcomes with finance at the center. The EIG suggested mandating a mapping of GST outcomes.
First Annual Dialogue on the Global Stocktake Informing the Preparation of Nationally Determined Contributions: This mandated event aims to facilitate the sharing of good practices on how the GST’s outcomes will inform the preparation of parties’ next nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Executive Secretary Simon Stiell reminded participants that “we cannot succeed without cooperation; no country can fight climate change alone.”
Discussions highlighted challenges in synchronizing national legislative processes with the NDC update cycle. Several countries gave examples of policy planning at different time scales and pointed to linkages between climate policy and broader national development plans.
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Carlos Fuller (Belize) proposed that parties hold informal informals to agree on the list of elements to be included in the draft text.
GRUPO SUR, AOSIS, LDCs, AILAC, AFRICAN GROUP, EU, EIG, the US, AUSTRALIA, NORWAY, REPUBLIC OF KOREA, JAPAN, CANADA, INDONESIA, AUSTRALIA, BANGLADESH, and THE GAMBIA supported this proposal, with BANGLADESH proposing that parties provide written submissions. BELIZE emphasized the importance of keeping the work programme alive and moving forward in the climate process, especially for small island states.
The ARAB GROUP, LMDCs, and RUSSIAN FEDERATION opposed, noting informal informals would be premature and that discussing additional elements for the draft decision text would be outside the consultations’ mandate.
Discussions will continue in informal informals, based on which the Co-Facilitators will prepare an informal note.
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: Discussions in informal consultations co-facilitated by Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) focused on sequencing of reviews and addressing inconsistencies. Parties considered, among other things:
the importance of sequencing for the environmental integrity of the framework;
what should be the consequences of inconsistencies;
whether parties should be allowed to re-submit information or reports to address inconsistencies; and 
whether and what information should be made publicly available, both during the reviews and if inconsistencies are identified.
On the Agreed Electronic Format (AEF), many parties expressed general satisfaction with the current design and supported adopting it with some fine-tuning. UKRAINE underscored that the information submission method should not impede parties’ ability to authorize internationally transferred mitigation outcomes. The AFRICAN GROUP called for focusing on key decisions that need to be adopted, rather than negotiating the actual AEF tables. The LMDCs said the current AEF does not reflect all parties’ views and the ARAB GROUP expressed doubt that the AEF will be ready for adoption this year.
Operation of the Clean Development Mechanism: In the informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Alick Muvundika (Zambia) and Karoliina Anttonen (Finland) introduced two technical papers prepared by the Secretariat on: resources for the functioning and operation of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); and the CDM registry’s operations beyond 2020. Discussions focused on resources, with parties asking for clarifications on the assumptions that informed the Secretariat’s paper. Some parties, including AOSIS, AILAC, and the UK, supported discussing timelines for winding down the CDM’s operations and the transfer of surplus resources to, for example, the Adaptation Fund and the Article 6.2 architecture. The LMDCs opposed discussing an end date until the Article 6.4 mechanism is operational.
Informal consultations will continue.
Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Pedro Pedroso Cuesta (Cuba), parties shared their views on the informal note, debating who should take the lead on mapping adaptation indicators. CANADA, JAPAN, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, and NEW ZEALAND suggested this be done by the Adaptation Committee. The AFRICAN GROUP preferred entrusting an ad hoc work programme with the exercise.
The EIG and AOSIS called for the Subsidiary Body Chairs to establish an expert working group for each thematic target, taking into account balanced regional representation and giving special consideration to small island developing states (SIDS). AILAC emphasized the need for financial support to ensure that experts can engage in person.
AOSIS, AILAC, GRUPO SUR, the ARAB GROUP, the UK, and CHINA noted that the criteria listed in the note are not actually criteria, with the ARAB GROUP emphasizing that the criteria should be specific to adaptation. JAPAN noted that the indicators do not support means of implementation.
Parties raised their concerns about the obligatory nature of the indicators; however, the Co-Facilitators reiterated their voluntary nature and promised to clarify this in the next iteration of the text.
Terms of Reference for the 2024 Review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts: In informal consultation co-facilitated by Meredith Ryder-Rude (US), parties shared their views on the Co-Facilitators’ elements paper. They generally agreed the paper captures points of convergence from parties’ submissions, including the evolution in the loss and damage landscape since the last review. AILAC emphasized that the review needs to take into consideration the evolving needs and priorities of developing countries, including for financial and technical support.
The G-77/CHINA requested that the Secretariat prepare reports on:
institutional arrangements;
the implementation of the outcomes of the last review of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), the first GST outcome, and the functions of the Santiago Network;
submissions on the review; and
the second and third Glasgow Dialogue.
The G-77/CHINA also suggested the Secretariat conduct a survey of national focal points and loss and damage contact points, as well as a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of the work of the WIM Executive Committee (WIM ExCom).
Parties decided to discuss points of divergence in informal informals and requested the Co-Facilitators prepare a clean version of the elements paper.
Dialogue on Loss and Damage Funding: Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) Chair Nabeel Munir opened the two-day dialogue by highlighting its objective: to reflect on how to enhance collaboration and coordination between loss and damage institutions.
Jean-Christophe Donnellier, Co-Chair of the Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage, pointed to ongoing discussions on institutional arrangements with the World Bank, the selection process for the Fund’s host country and its executive director, and rules of procedure. He also noted preparations for a high-level event on loss and damage finance are underway.
Alpha Kaloga, Co-Chair of the Santiago Network Advisory Board, noted the Board adopted the Network’s work programme and intends to hold meetings back to back with those of the WIM ExCom where possible and prepare joint annual reports. 
Camila Minerva Rodríguez, Co-Chair of the WIM ExCom, invited parties to use the 2024 WIM review as an opportunity to reflect on the implementation of the WIM’s function in the new loss and damage landscape.
Parties’ comments related to, among others: hopes for a quick capitalization of the Fund; minimum allocation for SIDS and LDCs; a quantum on loss and damage funding under the NCQG; and tracking the delivery of loss and damage funding. Discussions continued in breakout groups.
Second Meeting under the Ad Hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: Work programme Co-Chairs Zaheer Fakir (UAE) and Fiona Gilbert (Australia) invited participants to continue sharing their views. BARBADOS cautioned that the NCQG cannot be “all things to all people.” He noted uncertainty surrounding Paris Agreement Article 2.1c (on aligning finance flows) and said initiatives outside the UNFCCC, such as the Bridgetown Initiative, might be more suitable to address some matters. CHINA underscored developed countries’ obligations to support developing countries’ climate action and called the definition of the NCQG “almost a decade overdue.” MOROCCO called the NCQG “a beacon of hope” for vulnerable communities and cautioned against “taking it hostage” by discussing elements beyond the core mandate. ECUADOR called on developed countries to make proposals regarding the quantum of the goal. The MARSHALL ISLANDS said loans at market rates cannot be considered climate finance. Observer constituencies urged, among others, a beneficiary-centered approach that channels progressively higher grants to communities and called for amending the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) to be the backbone of NCQG transparency.
The Co-Chairs will revise their input paper.
Just Transition Work Programme: Contact-Group Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) invited further views on the draft text introduced the previous day.
The LDCs and CANADA suggested requesting constituted bodies to include information on progress towards integrating just transition into their processes in their reports. The EIG requested that the work of the pre-sessional just transition dialogue be better reflected in the text. COLOMBIA called for referencing internally displaced persons and, with NORWAY, urged ensuring children’s inclusion in the annual just transition dialogues. AUSTRALIA stressed highlighting the economic benefits of just transition. 
The G-77/CHINA reiterated its call for a new draft text which would, among others, include an assessment of the financial and technical needs for implementing just transition pathways. SOUTH AFRICA argued that the current text is biased towards the domestic dimension of the just transition and emphasized the importance of the international dimension.
AOSIS suggested the work programme focus on just transition pathways in 2025, and on comprehensive just transition policies and implementation in 2026.
Discussions will continue.
Provision of Financial and Technical Support for Non-Annex I Reporting Under the Convention: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Stephen Brine (Australia) recalled that parties adopted procedural conclusions on this item at SBI 59, but agreed to continue discussions at SBI 60, taking into account the draft text prepared in Dubai. He also pointed to a written update by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which the GEF then presented orally at the request of SOUTH AFRICA.
Parties gave the Co-Facilitators the mandate to update the draft to reflect recent developments, such as changes in the number of submitted reports. Several parties indicated they would provide further submissions, such as on the provision of technical support and the need for the GEF to support parties in an integrated way regarding their reporting under both the Convention and the Paris Agreement.
At the request of SOUTH AFRICA, supported by SWITZERLAND, the Secretariat will provide an overview of the support it provides at the outset of the next session.
Reporting Tools under the Enhanced Transparency Framework: During the informal consultations co-facilitated by Daniela Romano (Italy), discussions focused on the Secretariat’s technical paper on parties’ experience with the test version of the ETF’s reporting tools. Responding to parties’ questions, the Secretariat clarified that:
user manuals will be available for all reporting tools once their final version is launched;
there will be instruction videos and technical documents on how to navigate the tools;
a support team has been established within the Secretariat that will address any technical issues reported by parties; and
training sessions will be held in the Africa and Latin American and the Caribbean regions ahead of COP 29, as well as at COP 29.
The Co-Facilitator then introduced draft text for parties’ consideration. Informal consultations will continue on the text.
Capacity Building: Discussions in informal consultations co-facilitated by Cristina Carreiras (EU) focused on draft decision text on the second review of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building under the COP and the CMA. Parties considered the text line by line. The Co-Facilitators invited written input on the section on priority areas for future work of the Committee. Informal consultations will continue. 
Gender: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Marc-André Lafrance (Canada), parties discussed the review of the enhanced Lima work programme on gender (LWPG) and its gender action plan (GAP), as well as the reflections on future work to be undertaken on gender and climate change.
The G-77/CHINA underscored the need to move from planning to implementation, with the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by AOSIS, CHINA, and INDONESIA, urging financial and technical support for the action plan’s implementation to close the gap between developed and developing countries.
AILAC, BRAZIL, and MEXICO called for concluding the review of the enhanced LWPG before working on a more ambitious GAP. AILAC, with the US, the UK, and PHILIPPINES, also emphasized the need to advance gender mainstreaming in the climate change process.
Parties agreed to use the decision on the review of the first LWPG and its GAP (Decision 3/CP.25) as a basis for draft text.
In the Corridors
Are there secret Swifties walking around the World Conference Center? Suspicions were raised when one delegate implored Just Transition Work Programme colleagues to recognize that “this isn’t 1989, and these aren’t champagne problems. Clearly, everything has changed.”
Taylor fans and delegates alike recognized all too well that many points need to be sorted out in the discussions on the new finance goal—or else, noted an observer, “we’re going to have bad blood at the finance COP.”
The need to shake it off was just as clear in the Global Stocktake dialogue. Rather than remaining trapped in folklore from past decisions, many saw a need to fill in the blank space of the next round of NDCs. 
“There aren’t 22 ways about it,” one long-time participant stressed. “Ten cruel summers have gone by since we adopted the Paris Agreement—now we need to get out of the woods and make real strides towards making it a love story (UNFCCC’s version).”"
7,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-7jun2024,True,Daily report for 7 June 2024,"Finance was a key topic throughout the day. In the morning, delegates engaged in a dialogue on loss and damage funding. In the afternoon, tension emerged over priorities in budget management in the intergovernmental process, with many keen to ensure inclusive participation opportunities.  
Negotiations and Mandated Events
First Annual Dialogue on the Global Stocktake Informing the Preparation of Nationally Determined Contributions: The second and last day of this mandated event saw discussions on issues such as: the legal foundations of the European Commission’s 2040 Climate Target; the value of sector-led climate targets; and the role of line ministries in implementing nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The International Energy Agency highlighted findings from its new special report “Strategies for Affordable and Fair Clean Energy Transitions,” including that speeding up the transition to clean energy technologies improves the affordability of energy and can relieve pressures on the cost of living.
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: During the informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) introduced a draft CMA decision text prepared based on parties’ written input. Most parties supported mandating the Secretariat to develop the common nomenclatures, noting it is a technical issue and there is no need to invite submissions of views and proposals. On guidance in relation to corresponding adjustments for multi-year and single-year NDCs, parties expressed diverging views on whether to defer consideration to 2025 or 2028.
Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: During the informal consultations in the morning and afternoon, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) introduced a draft CMA decision text prepared based on parties’ written input. They explained that in addition to existing elements, the text contains three new proposals on: share of proceeds (SOP) for adaptation, transition of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) afforestation and reforestation (A/R) activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism, and baseline methodologies. 
Morning discussions focused on the new proposals. The LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs) clarified that their SOP proposal would mean that rather than benefit from an exemption, LDCs could apply the SOP for adaptation but allocate it to their national adaptation funds instead of to the Adaptation Fund. Some, such as CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, queried how it would work and whether, for instance, such national adaptation funds would hold accounts within the mechanism registry for transfer of funds, similar to the Adaptation Fund.
GRUPO SUR explained the proposal on CDM A/R projects affirms existing rules relating to the transition of CDM activities and responds to the mandate from the Supervisory Body regarding guidance on removals. Most parties questioned the need to single out a particular sector, considering the CMA has already adopted rules for the transition of all eligible CDM activities, which would include eligible CDM A/R activities.
The COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS (CfRN) clarified that the proposal relating to baseline methodologies aims to ensure aggregation of baselines so that all emitting activities and projects are taken into consideration alongside the relevant Article 6.4 activities to give a true picture of countries’ emissions levels. Many parties expressed their inability to take a position pending a better understanding of the proposal, its purpose, and its implications.
In the afternoon, informal consultations focused on authorizations, and emission avoidance and conservation enhancement activities. Regarding authorizations, most parties lamented the length and large number of options in the text, preferring to use the informal note prepared by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) as a basis of discussions noting it better reflects discussions at SBSTA 59. They stressed text should focus on key issues, such as changes to authorization and whether mitigation units can be authorized after issuance.
Parties also considered the options on emission avoidance and conservation enhancement activities. Some, such as AOSIS, CfRN and the EU, preferred to conclude, at this meeting, that such activities are not allowed. Other groups and parties, including the AFRICAN GROUP, LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), PHILIPPINES, JAPAN, the US, and others, supported the option to continue consideration of this issue as part of the review of the mechanism’s rules to be undertaken by CMA 10 in 2028.
The ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), CfRN, and the EU expressed willingness to accept continuing consideration as part of the 2028 review, provided inclusion of such activities is not allowed pending the outcome of the review. The US, supported by the ARAB GROUP and RUSSIAN FEDERATION, recalled the option to clarify that these activities may be considered as emission removals or reductions if they meet the mechanism’s eligibility requirements.
Operation of the Clean Development Mechanism: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Alick Muvundika (Zambia) and Karoliina Anttonen (Finland), discussions focused on the Secretariat’s technical paper on operations of the CDM registry. Diverging views remained on setting an end date for all CDM operations, with some parties supporting the earliest possible date, and others preferring to wait until after the Article 6.4 mechanism is fully operational.
Regarding certified emission reductions (CERs) held in the pending account for non-payment of the SOP, the EU, supported by the EIG, but opposed by the AFRICAN GROUP, LMDCs and others, supported administrative cancellation of such CERs. AOSIS and the AFRICAN GROUP, supported checking in with the relevant project participants ahead of COP 29 to determine their intentions regarding the CERs.
The AFRICAN GROUP, supported by LMDCs and ARAB GROUP, but opposed by the EU, supported deferring further discussions under this agenda item to SBSTA 61 or 62 so that any decision relating to the Article 6.4 mechanism registry can be taken into consideration.
Informal consultations will continue.
Nairobi Work Programme on Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation to Climate Change: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Camila Minerva Rodriguez Tavarez (Dominican Republic), parties shared views on draft text on the Nairobi Work Programme (NWP).
The G-77/CHINA called for deleting provisions on the NWP’s contributions to the work programme on indicators for the global goal on adaptation, to avoid prejudging the latter’s outcomes. The EU, US, JAPAN, and AUSTRALIA opposed, stating that the provisions would not prejudge the work.
The LMDCs noted the need for collaboration between the NWP and the constituted bodies. The INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC) pointed out the NWP’s lack of activity across all regions, particularly in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, and requested the SBSTA Chair to take note of the need for further financial resources to carry out NWP activities.
The Co-Facilitators will revise their draft text.
Dialogue on Loss and Damage Funding: The second and last day of this mandated event started with reports on the first day’s breakout group discussions, during which participants touched upon, among others:
risk of process fatigue in the absence of results on the ground;
the importance of risk management and links between preparedness, response, and long-term resilience;
availability, affordability, and standardization of data for risk assessment;
funding reaching those at the forefront, with a trigger-based disbursement of funding, minimum percentage allocation for small island developing states (SIDS) and LDCs, and small grants channeled through programmatic approaches;
support for national-level coordination; and
regular meetings between the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM ExCom), Santiago Network, and Fund.
Participants then reflected on recent progress and how to further enhance it. Many underscored the importance of the first annual high-level dialogue on coordination and complementarity among loss and damage funding arrangements (called for in Decision 5/CMA.5). Several called for: holding the dialogue before COP 29; fostering actual dialogue, rather than a series of statements; engagement with stakeholders such as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Organization for Migration; and a follow-up process to leverage discussions. Many highlighted the 2024 WIM review as an opportunity to reflect on the changed loss and damage landscape.
Adaptation Fund: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Ralph Bodle (Germany) and Amena Yauvoli (Fiji), parties agreed to postpone the consideration of the matter, but diverged on when to resume it. The EU, SWITZERLAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, and NORWAY favored putting it on the agenda for SB 61 in Baku. Pointing to a possible resolution on the Article 6.4 mechanism in Baku, they emphasized the need to ensure the Fund is ready to receive SOP that might materialize before SB 62. The AFRICAN GROUP and ARAB GROUP preferred postponing to SB 62, emphasizing the matter should be reconsidered once a SOP actually materializes, not when it is likely to materialize. CHINA supported this, adding it is unlikely SOP would materialize by then. 
The Co-Facilitators will consult with the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) on the way forward.
Just Transition Work Programme: In the contact group co-chaired by Marianne Karlsen (Norway) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago), disagreements continued on the G-77/CHINA’s proposal to establish a work plan for the Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP). The US opposed the proposal, arguing that the proposed work plan was a premature anticipation of the outcome of the JTWP’s review in 2026. She underlined that the role of the contact group is to consider issues raised in the pre-sessional dialogue and outline possible improvements to the dialogue.
The ARAB GROUP and LMDCs urged for the JTWP to be implemented based on the need for sustainable development and poverty eradication, and according to national circumstances and the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). IRAN stressed that just transition cannot take place in the presence of “unilateral coercive measures,” including trade measures.
TRADE UNION NGOs stressed the need for an expert body to help inform the implementation of the JTWP which includes relevant stakeholders. YOUTH NGOs (YOUNGO) called for an intersectional approach to just transition, and for reform of education systems to ensure adequate training for youth.
Discussions will continue.
Research and Systematic Observation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Patricia Nyinguro (Kenya) and Frank McGovern (Ireland), parties welcomed the Co-Facilitators’ informal note as a good basis for negotiations.
AOSIS, the LDCs, AFRICAN GROUP, EU, SWITZERLAND, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, the UK, and INDONESIA proposed welcoming statements related to research and systematic observation made during the opening plenary of the Subsidiary Bodies. The AFRICAN GROUP proposed acknowledging the role of national meteorological and hydrological services with regard to information on marine and mountain ecosystems. GRUPO SUR, the US, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, and BELIZE suggested merging elements related to recognizing the importance of sustained financial support for systematic observations needed to meet the goals of the Convention and Paris Agreement.
The LDCs, AFRICAN GROUP, EU and AOSIS suggested noting the beginning of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s seventh assessment cycle and, opposed by the ARAB GROUP, recognizing its critical role in providing relevant information to parties.
AOSIS, the EU, CANADA, and CHILE acknowledged the organization of the 16th meeting of the research dialogue and the research needs discussed therein. The ARAB GROUP objected, recalling the failure to consider parties’ submissions in defining the meeting’s theme.
Discussions will continue in informal informals.
Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Clement Yow Mulalap (Micronesia) invited parties’ comments on draft text.
GRUPO SUR, ARAB GROUP, and CHINA objected to a paragraph inviting the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement to decide that the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) of the Local Community and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP) shall also serve the Agreement. They noted the need to better understand the implications of such a decision. The US, seeing no issue with the FWG serving the Paris Agreement, suggested informal engagement on the matter.
The ARAB GROUP raised questions on the inclusion of the paragraph on budgetary implications of the Secretariat’s activities on the LCIPP. The EU noted that this is standard practice.
Parties agreed to bracket both contested paragraphs.
Joint Work on Implementation of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food Security: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Una May Gordon (Belize), parties reported back from discussions held in informal informals, specifically on the list of workshop topics.
The G-77/CHINA emphasized the need for a workshop on means of implementation, which includes finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building, but suggested that priorities must first be identified by parties so the Secretariat can take those into consideration. The EU, the US, SOUTH SUDAN, NEW ZEALAND, and AUSTRALIA noted similarity in some topics in the informal note and suggested merging them.
The EIG, US, and UK proposed a workshop on integration of agriculture and food systems considerations in NDCs, national adaptation plans, and long-term strategies, among others. JAPAN highlighted the importance of innovation in achieving food security. ARMENIA agreed, suggesting inclusion of cutting-edge technology and artificial intelligence that provide solutions to climate change in agriculture.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ ORGANIZATIONS urged for the recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge. YOUNGO underscored the need to have a clear roadmap and tangible progress at the next COP. ENVIRONMENTAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS called for workshops to be open to observers.
Discussions continued in informal informals.
Arrangements for Intergovernmental Meetings: SBI Chair Nabeel Munir chaired contact group discussions, which continued to focus on increasing the efficiency of the UNFCCC process.
The LDCs, UK, and CANADA were open to clustering certain issues under umbrella items, such as in the form of “matters related to...” The LMDCs, ARAB GROUP, and CHINA opposed, with the ARAB GROUP arguing that determining those umbrella items would lead to further inefficient deliberations. NORWAY, with the UK, supported multi-annual agenda planning to ensure better alignment with certain mandates’ cycles. 
The US, UK, and AUSTRALIA lamented the Secretariat’s decision not to provide a virtual platform at SB 60. The AFRICAN GROUP suggested that the Secretariat provide a list of options for innovative funding methods so as to increase revenue.
Administrative, Financial, and Institutional Matters: In a contact group, Co-Chairs Gabriela Blatter (Switzerland) and Zita Wilks (Gabon) pointed to a document outlining the Secretariat’s response to questions submitted by parties after the first contact group session. They also invited views on draft decision text.
The UK called for better capturing concerns over the lack of consultation before decisions to cancel the regional climate weeks and virtual access to SB 60 were made. The ARAB GROUP called for making the report from the United Nations Board of Auditors available so that parties can reflect on how to handle its recommendations.
Parties debated how to foster a decision-making process that is better informed by budgetary considerations. The ARAB GROUP argued this should be considered centrally rather than under individual agenda items, to ensure proportionality is taken into account. He also suggested exploring revenue-generating options, such as COP participation fees for the private sector.
The ARAB GROUP also requested more clarification on the Executive Secretary’s travel expenditures and expressed concern that the travel and communication budgets are compromising resources for the intergovernmental process.
The Co-Facilitators invited further written submissions and will revise their draft text.
In the Corridors
The wisdom of the Wu-Tang Clan came alive on Friday: delegates in sessions concerning the budget and future meetings came up against the hard reality that Cash Rules Everything Around the UNFCCC.
With regional events and virtual participation opportunities under the knife due to budgetary constraints, some delegates were transparent in their frustration with how funds have been handled. One delegation shared that they resorted to providing earmarked funding to ensure that the issues dear to them and which they saw threatened—such as developing the reporting tools under the Paris Agreement—were funded.
Money concerns were also apparent in the briefing by the incoming COP 29 Presidency. If the Marshall Islands were openly appalled by price hikes in Baku accommodations, they were not the only ones: the Dutch delegation and many others were vocal in their disapproval—and their concern over civil society’s participation and freedom of assembly in Azerbaijan. “The Presidency has some reassuring to do,” one long-time observer noted. “Here’s hoping we show up in Baku with a bit more money and a bit more trust.”"
8,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-daily-report-8jun2024,True,Daily report for 8 June 2024,"Delegates continued sharing views on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG), which attracted a crowd. The issue of finance also crept up in other rooms, whether regarding what to do with money from the Clean Development Development (CDM) Trust Fund or what focus to give a new dialogue on implementing the Global Stocktake’s (GST) outcome.
Negotiations and Mandated Events
Procedural and Logistical Elements of the Overall Global Stocktake Process: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Patrick Spicer (Canada) and Thureya Al Ali (UAE) invited views on a revised informal note. Participants made a number of specific textual proposals concerning, inter alia:
whether the technical assessment should take place over an accelerated time frame;
improving the transition between the technical assessment and the consideration of outputs;
inputs and information-gathering, with the ARAB GROUP urging a balance between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and non-IPCC sources; and
the composition of the High-Level Committee of future GSTs.
The Co-Facilitators will refine the informal note.
Modalities of the Dialogue on Implementing the Global Stocktake Outcomes: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Patrick Spicer (Canada) and Ricardo Marshall (Barbados), parties shared views on an informal note which outlines the three different visions they have with regard to the scope of the dialogue and its modalities. 
Parties reiterated their preferences with respect to the dialogue covering all aspects of the GST outcome or focusing on finance. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG) and the EU objected to including elements on the dialogue’s “origin story,” noting parties’ divergent interpretation thereof. The INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC) considered the dialogue should focus on all actionable elements of the GST outcome, with emphasis on gaps and barriers related to means of implementation. The UK expressed willingness to engage on AILAC’s suggestion, asking for clarification on how it would work. 
EIG and NEW ZEALAND expressed concern over some groups’ reluctance to discuss mitigation, with the EU underscoring the GST outcome calls for action by all parties, not just developed countries.
The EU, US, and AUSTRALIA called for the dialogue to address issues that are not covered in existing workstreams, with the EU pointing to the issue of reforming the global financial architecture, among others. The LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs) agreed on the need to avoid duplication and underscored that tracking collective progress will be addressed in the next GST. 
The Co-Facilitators will refine their informal note, keeping the three visions separate but streamlining each.
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Kay Harrison (New Zealand) proposed that, due to divergent views on how to move forward, participants discuss the improvement of future global dialogues and investment-focused events.
EIG, the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), AILAC, AUSTRALIA, the US, and others stated that they would only engage on the topic with the assurance that other issues would also be discussed. LMDCs, the ARAB GROUP, and others supported the proposal, although the ARAB GROUP noted that certain parties were “holding progress hostage until we discuss issues outside the mandate of the work plan.”
Parties were ultimately unable to agree on a way forward
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: During informal consultations co-facilitated by Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway), parties continued to provide general reflections on the  draft CMA decision text. Parties identified where their views had not been fully reflected and also sought clarification on some of the options in the text.
In the afternoon, the Co-Facilitators invited parties’ input for the preparation of draft conclusions, including items from the draft CMA decision text that parties may wish to move into the draft conclusions. All parties agreed to send the draft CMA decision text for continued consideration at SBSTA 61.
On intersessional work, many parties, including EIG, the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS (CfRN), AOSIS, the EU, UK, US, and others, opposed by the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), supported intersessional work focusing on crunch issues such as authorizations, registries and the Agreed Electronic Format. CfRN said the intersessional work should include high-level participation. Parties also expressed diverging views on whether it should be fully in-person, virtual, or hybrid.
On elements that the SBSTA can conclude on at SBSTA 60, most parties supported moving the text on emission avoidance to the draft conclusions and specify that it should be considered as part of the review of the Article 6.2 guidance in 2028. The PHILIPPINES opposed, preferring that the text remain in the draft CMA decision text to be forwarded to SBSTA 61. Other elements proposed by parties for inclusion in the draft conclusions include common nomenclatures, confidential information, and corresponding adjustments.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare draft conclusions.
Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) invited parties’ views on elements to include in draft conclusions.
Parties agreed on the need to continue consideration of the draft CMA decision text at SBSTA 61, although they had diverging views on whether to “forward,” “welcome,” or “note” the text in the SBSTA 60 conclusions.
The EU, US, UK, and JAPAN expressed willingness to consider intersessional work if held in conjunction with meetings of the Article 6.2 group and focused on cross-cutting issues such as registries and authorization. The AFRICAN GROUP, LDCs, CfRN, LMDCs, CANADA, and others said there is no need for intersessional work.
Additionally, most parties supported moving the text on national arrangements, and on emission avoidance and conservation enhancement activities, from the draft CMA decision text to the conclusions, and to consider these topics as part of the 2028 review of the mechanisms’ rules, modalities, and procedures. Diverging views remained on whether to specify that emission avoidance activities will not be included in the mechanism pending the review.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare draft conclusions.
Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.8: Contact Group Co-Chairs Jacqui Ruesga (New Zealand) and Kristin Qui (Trinidad and Tobago) invited parties to reflect on the in-session workshop on non-market approaches and the two spin-off groups held over the last few days, and to provide input on the SBSTA conclusions, including regarding potential intersessional work.
Parties expressed appreciation for the workshop and spin-off groups. LMDCs, supported by the EU, GRUPO SUR, and the US supported using future spin-off groups as capacity-building opportunities, focusing, among others, on how to use the web-based platform. Parties also provided suggestions on how to improve future spin-off groups, such as providing guiding questions in advance, inviting stakeholder participation, and assigning a champion to encourage engagement in the discussions.
The Co-Chairs will prepare draft conclusions.
Operation of the Clean Development Mechanism: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Alick Muvundika (Zambia) and Karoliina Anttonen (Finland), discussions focused on the proposal by some parties to postpone further consultations under this agenda item to SBSTA 61 or 62.
The EU, EIG, AOSIS, and the UK opposed postponement, underlining a decision must be made on this item by the Conference of the Parties meeting as Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) in Baku. LMDCs and the ARAB GROUP supported postponement to SBSTA 61 and BRAZIL preferred postponement to SBSTA 62.
The AFRICAN GROUP, opposed by BRAZIL, proposed agreeing on an amount to be transferred to the Adaptation Fund as a minimum outcome of discussions. The EU supported this proposal, noting that money can also be transferred to support the development of the Article 6 infrastructure.
LMDCs, supported by the ARAB GROUP, proposed requesting the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper for consideration in Baku, outlining: ongoing activities within the CDM; when the Article 6.4 mechanism registry will become operational; and a detailed financial breakdown of the CDM Trust Fund.
The Co-Facilitators will prepare draft text.
Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Tina Kobilšek (Slovenia), parties shared their views on a revised informal note.
The G-77/CHINA said the Adaptation Committee (AC) may contribute to, but not lead, the mapping process on indicators. AOSIS stated that allowing the AC to lead the work may politicize the process and result in lack of transparency.
On engaging experts in the indicator process, the AFRICAN GROUP stressed the importance of a party-driven nomination of experts and emphasized diversity in terms of gender, skills, and experience. AILAC and EIG called for balanced regional representation of the expert group, particularly from developing countries, with AILAC urging sufficient financial support for them.
AILAC, GRUPO SUR, and EIG welcomed the provision recognizing the importance of engaging with Indigenous Peoples in all phases of the work under the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA).
AOSIS and LMDCs cautioned against increasing developing countries’ reporting burden. AOSIS, AILAC, and LDCs supported the inclusion of data readiness in the proposal.
National Adaptation Plans: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Antwi Boasiako Amoah (Ghana), parties agreed that the draft decision text is a good basis for further negotiations.
JAPAN emphasized the benefits of involving the private sector to promote and contribute to adaptation in communities. Others, such as GRUPO SUR and LMDCs, opposed, with PAKISTAN enumerating the reasons why private sector involvement is a challenge for many developing countries.
LDCs, with AOSIS and the EU, called for stronger language recognizing the special needs and circumstances of small island developing states (SIDS) and LDCs in all relevant paragraphs of the text. The EU and GRENADA suggested stronger language on gender-sensitive approaches to the implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs). CANADA encouraged text that clearly conveys utilizing NAPs to facilitate climate action, particularly with contributions from Indigenous Peoples.
The Co-Facilitators will revise their text.
Terms of Reference for the 2024 Review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu) presented an elements paper, noting that further work was needed to: streamline the document; structure the section on scope; and consider modalities.
On inputs to the review, the G-77/CHINA took exception to the Co-Facilitators’ decision to feature the group’s suggested list of inputs in a footnote, rather than the main body of the text. The Co-Facilitators specified that inclusion in a footnote suggests adoption alongside the text, not any lesser importance.
On scope, the G-77/CHINA supported a broad review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) and its functions, and pressed for the inclusion of stakeholders from outside the Convention. The US, opposed by AILAC and GRUPO SUR, suggested considering how the functions of the WIM have been implemented, but not review the functions themselves.
LDCs said the review should reflect on the establishment of the new loss and damage Fund. AILAC and the ARAB GROUP opposed renegotiating the composition of the WIM Executive Committee.
Discussions continued in informal informals.
Second Meeting under the Ad Hoc Work Programme on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: Work programme Co-Chair Zaheer Fakir (UAE) invited views on a revised input paper. Parties considered the paper could be further streamlined, with various groups and parties pointing to elements they want to see removed, inserted, or reinserted.
The EU, US, AUSTRALIA, and CANADA considered progress could be achieved by fostering substantive discussions on issues such as access and transparency, pointing to commonalities between parties’ views on these. 
The ARAB GROUP and CUBA called for engagement on the quantum of the goal, with the AFRICAN GROUP calling for clarity on provision and mobilization targets. CANADA noted agreement on the importance of public finance by developed countries and suggested informal engagement on broader consideration aimed at closing the finance gap.
The Co-Chairs will revise their paper before the next session. 
Just Transition Work Programme: Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) presented draft conclusions text. He expressed hope that parties would agree on the draft conclusions to be adopted at SB 60 and then move on to draft decision language, due by the end of SB 61.
CANADA, the US, and JAPAN suggested deleting a paragraph which encourages holding the second dialogue under the work programme intersessionally, well in advance of the CMA meeting in Baku. They argued that this text contradicts the spirit of engaging both party and non-party stakeholders, and that dialogues should take place in conjunction with meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies.
The G-77/CHINA requested language encouraging increasing the participation of non-party stakeholders from developing countries. CANADA requested a paragraph encouraging the Chairs of the Subsidiary Bodies to prepare an informal report reflecting the summary of dialogue discussions “in a balanced and comprehensive manner.”
LDCs and LMDCs requested bracketing a paragraph specifying discussions at SB 61 would take into account draft decision text prepared by the Co-Chairs until parties can consider the text.
The Co-Chairs will revise the proposed draft conclusions and prepare draft decision text.
Joint Work on Implementation of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food Security: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Annela Anger-Kraavi (EU), parties mandated the Co-Facilitators to prepare a new draft conclusion text based on the significant progress achieved during informal informals.
Dialogue on Action for Climate Empowerment: SBI Chair Nabeel Munir (Pakistan) opened this two-day mandated event, recalling that Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) is a toolbox for empowering society to collectively tackle climate change. He noted parties are now laying the grounds for their next nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which is a key opportunity to build a whole-of-society consensus towards enhanced climate action. 
Executive Secretary Simon Stiell urged parties to address education and training in their NDCs. “We cannot let shortage of qualified labor slow the transition,” he said, noting the need for both upskilling within existing professions and developing the future workforce. He underscored the importance of peoples’ buy-in, without which there is a risk of backlash against climate policy.
Discussions touched upon, among others:
leveraging non-formal forms of education, such as scouts groups or sports clubs;
creating national youth councils to promote youth engagement in decision making;
providing financial support for ACE implementation, such as through the International Climate Initiative or the Youth4Climate Call For Solutions; and
tailoring messages to specific cultural contexts.
Arrangements for Intergovernmental Meetings: SBI Chair Munir requested that the Secretariat report on the UNFCCC Code of Conduct. MEXICO requested further information on follow-up to complaints, suggesting there is “room for improvement” in the system.
Participants discussed the issue of observers’ attendance in an increasingly crowded and resource-limited process. The EU, CANADA, NORWAY, and MEXICO requested that host country agreements be made public, and that these agreements include language ensuring that all stakeholders retain full enjoyment of human rights. BRAZIL requested that greater representation be secured for observers from developing country organizations. SWITZERLAND warned that setting fees for developed country organizations could unintentionally bar organizations from the process.
CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK stressed that effective participation of observers should not be measured the number of participants, but in the quality of participation. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ ORGANIZATIONS called for Indigenous Peoples to be identified as rights holders, not stakeholders, and therefore be given speaking priority ahead of intergovernmental organizations.
In the Corridors
Despite the brilliant sunshine and the tourists drinking lemon sodas by the river, the Saturday mood in the World Conference Center was decidedly studious. Eagle-eyed long-term delegates noted the absence of a stocktaking plenary at the end of the week’s deliberations: the event, though not required, has been a staple of past negotiations.
“Are things not going as well as we want them to, or is everyone just too busy to take stock right now?” one observer asked. Those surveyed angled towards the latter: with several items going into informal informals, it was clear that not all Co-Facilitators were going to have the Sunday off that most participants were longing for.
“If we’re all busy—good,” one delegate nodded. “We only have four days to wrap things up before Baku.” Those heading out into the sunset with visions of Biergartens and Spaghettieis seemed trusting that a day off will be enough to untangle the worst disagreements—or at least hoped that would be the case."
9,https://enb.iisd.org/bonn-climate-change-conference-sbi60-sbsta60-summary,False,"Summary report, 3–13 June 2024","Just six months ago, governments delivered a milestone decision at the 2023 Dubai Climate Change Conference. The outcome of the Paris Agreement’s first Global Stocktake (GST) called on parties to contribute to global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems in this critical decade. This decision also encourages the next round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), due in February 2025, to include ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets aligned with the objective to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Many hoped this would be a necessary course correction to stave off the most dangerous effects of climate change and ensure that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is fit for purpose.
The 2024 Bonn Climate Conference was the first opportunity for parties to discuss just how to implement these calls and other elements of the GST decision. However, these discussions did not leave delegates very optimistic that the GST will lead parties to the much needed course correction.
After two weeks of negotiations, parties did not make much progress in defining the modalities of a new dialogue on implementing the GST outcome. In fact, they did not reflect much on modalities. There were entrenched disagreements over the dialogue’s intended scope: should it focus on means of implementation, especially finance, or reflect on the implementation of all elements of the GST decision?
Discussions on the mitigation work programme were even more contentious. Parties could not reach any agreement, not even to invite intersessional submissions or capture discussions held in Bonn to inform discussions at the next meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024. Many groups and parties denounced the conduct of these negotiations, emphasizing that mitigation action should not be a “taboo topic” in the process.
Many also expressed disappointment about the lack of progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation, as well as the identification of research needs and the timeliness of inputs by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in discussions on research and systematic observation.
On a range of issues, including gender, parties only adopted procedural conclusions, by which they agree to continue consideration of the matter at the next session, informed by discussions held in Bonn. Progress was overall hard to pin down and mostly related to the launch of review processes.
Looking ahead to the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Baku, many were wary of the lack of substantive progress on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, which is to be defined prior to 2025. Parties’ positions remain far apart on key issues such as the donor and recipient base, and they have yet to meaningfully discuss the quantum of the goal. Agreement on the goal will define the trajectory of climate action for years to come, making it a crucial issue to sort out.
The 2024 Bonn Climate Change Conference convened from 3-13 June 2024 at the World Conference Center in Bonn, Germany. It consisted of meetings of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, 30 mandated events, and a series of side events. There were 8,606 registered participants, including 3,444 party delegates, 2,467 observers from non-governmental organizations, and 225 media representatives.
A Brief History of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement
The international political response to climate change began with the 1992 adoption of the UNFCCC, which sets out the basic legal framework and principles for international climate change cooperation with the aim of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, has 197 parties. 
To boost the effectiveness of the UNFCCC, parties adopted the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997. It commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve quantified emission reduction targets for a basket of six GHGs. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and has 192 parties. Its first commitment period took place from 2008 to 2012 followed by the second commitment period, 2013-2020.
In December 2015, parties adopted the Paris Agreement, which includes the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. It also aims to increase parties’ ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and make financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development. Under the terms of the Agreement, all countries will submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and will review the aggregate progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation every five years through a Global Stocktake (GST). The Agreement further sets out an Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) for national reporting by all parties. The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016. To date, 193 parties have ratified the Agreement.
Recent Key Turning Points 
Fiji/Bonn: The Fiji/Bonn Climate Change Conference convened from 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, under the Presidency of Fiji. The Conference of the Parties (COP) launched the Talanoa Dialogue, a facilitative dialogue to take stock of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals. The COP also established the “Fiji Momentum for Implementation,” a decision giving prominence to pre-2020 implementation and ambition. Parties also provided guidance on the completion of Paris Agreement’s implementing details, the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP), and decided that the Adaptation Fund shall serve the Paris Agreement, subject to decisions to be taken by Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1-3).
Katowice: The Katowice Climate Change Conference convened from 2-14 December 2018 in Katowice, Poland, concluding a busy year that featured an additional negotiation session to advance work on the PAWP. Parties adopted the “Katowice Climate Package,” which finalized nearly all of the PAWP, including decisions to facilitate common interpretation and implementation of the Paris Agreement on the mitigation section of NDCs, adaptation communications, ETF, GST, and financial transparency, among others. Work on cooperative approaches, under Article 6 of the Agreement, was not concluded, and parties agreed to conclude it in 2019. The COP was unable to agree on whether to “welcome” or “note” the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5°C of Global Warming. 
Chile/Madrid: The Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference convened from 2-13 December 2019 in Madrid, under the Presidency of Chile. Delegates established the Santiago Network for Averting, Minimizing, and Addressing Loss and Damage, and adopted the enhanced five-year Lima Work Programme and its Gender Action Plan. Parties also adopted three “cover decisions” under the different governing bodies, each named the “Chile/Madrid Time for Action.” On many issues, notably Article 6 and long-term finance, parties could not reach agreement. 
Glasgow: The Glasgow Climate Change Conference convened in Scotland from 31 October – 12 November 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic-related interruption. Parties finalized the Paris Agreement rulebook, adopting guidelines, rules, and a work programme on Article 6 and agreeing on the format of reporting under the ETF. Parties adopted the “Glasgow Climate Pact,” a series of three overarching cover decisions that, for the first time, included a reference to phasing down unabated coal power and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. They also agreed to work programmes on a global goal for adaptation, and on urgently scaling up mitigation; created the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage; established a process towards defining a new collective quantified goal on climate finance; and launched an annual dialogue on ocean-based climate action. 
Sharm El-Sheikh: The Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference convened in Egypt from 6-20 November 2022 and concluded with the adoption of 60 decisions. For the first time, parties recognized the need for finance to respond to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change and established a fund and funding arrangements, with the details to be worked out in 2023. Key elements in the package leading to this agreement were the work programmes on urgently scaling up mitigation ambition and the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). Parties also adopted two overarching cover decisions, together called the “Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan.” Highlights of the cover decisions include: 
retaining the call to phase down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, as adopted in the Glasgow Climate Pact; 
urging parties that have not yet communicated new or updated NDCs or long-term low GHG development strategies to do so as soon as possible before CMA 5; 
establishing a work programme on just transition to discuss pathways to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement; and 
calling for multilateral development bank reform.
The meeting also launched the selection process for the host of the Santiago Network secretariat and continued the technical dialogue under the GST, among other issues.
Dubai: The Dubai Climate Change Conference convened in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30 November – 13 December 2023. It delivered a milestone decision: parties concluded the Paris Agreement’s first GST. The decision, among others, calls on parties to contribute to global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems in this critical decade. It also encourages the next NDCs, due in February 2025, to include ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets aligned with the objective to limit global warming to 1.5°C.
Parties also adopted a decision paving the way for the operationalization of the new loss and damage fund, agreed on the host of the Santiago Network secretariat, adopted the GGA framework, and launched a work programme on adaptation indicators, among others.
Report of the Meetings
The 60th session of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SBs) opened on Monday, 3 June. Parties and observers presented their opening statements, outlining expectations for the negotiations.
Procedural Matters
Adoption of the Agendas: The RUSSIAN FEDERATION objected to the adoption of the agendas on the basis that four of its negotiators had not been provided with visas by the host country. After a short suspension, they withdrew their objection, reserving the right to block the adoption of outcomes should the visa matter not be resolved. Later in the day, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION reported the outstanding visas had been granted.
Nabeel Munir (Pakistan), Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), and Harry Vreuls (the Netherlands), Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), pointed to constructive pre-sessional consultations with groups and parties on the agendas. Parties agreed to adopt the provisional agendas (FCCC/SBI/2024/4 and FCCC/SBSTA/2024/4) without the items proposed for inclusion by BOLIVIA, on developed countries’ immediate and urgent action to achieve net-zero emissions at the latest by 2030 and net-negative emissions thereafter, and on means of implementation for alternative policy approaches to results-based payments. Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), called out the failure of Global North countries to fulfill their obligations, highlighting that developed countries’ net-zero emissions targets fall short of what is required to address the climate crisis and lamented the onset of “carbon colonialism.” He invited the Troika of COP Presidencies (UAE, Azerbaijan, and Brazil) to work on developing a roadmap to facilitate non-market approaches to mitigation and adaptation.
During the closing plenary, the SB Chairs noted that they held consultations on Bolivia’s proposed agenda items, but no consensus had been reached on a way forward.
Organization of Work: During the two-week meeting, contact groups convened on:
the just transition work programme;
matters relating to the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures;
the framework for non-market approaches (NMAs) referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.8;
arrangements for intergovernmental meetings; and
administrative, financial, and institutional matters.
Informal consultations convened on all other agenda items included in the adopted agendas.
During the opening plenary, BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China), supported by EGYPT and BOLIVIA, expressed concern about the compilation and synthesis of Annex I parties’ biennial reports, noting projected increases in Annex I parties’ GHG emissions between 2020 and 2030. He requested dedicated time and space to consider this agenda item, including the synthesis report. The SBI Chair confirmed that each item under this agenda item will be considered separately.
SBI Chair Munir noted that no L documents would be prepared for strictly procedural conclusions, but these would be read out in plenary and reflected in the meeting report.
Global Stocktake
Procedural and Logistical Elements of the Overall Global Stocktake Process: The GST is a collective assessment of efforts and results on all areas of the Paris Agreement. It is intended to inform the development of NDCs. The first GST concluded at CMA 5 in Dubai. The objective in Bonn was to discuss how to refine the procedural and logistical elements of the GST process based on the experiences of the first GST, with a view to adopt a decision in Baku.
Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Patrick Spicer (Canada) and Thureya Al Ali (UAE), and took place on 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12 June. Salient points of discussion included, among others:
whether and how to align the publication of the IPCC’s seventh assessment cycle with the second GST to include the best available science;
improving the transition between the technical assessment and consideration of output phases of the GST; and
the composition of the High-Level Committee of future GSTs.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2024/L.3), the SBs, inter alia:
take note of the informal note prepared by the Co-Facilitators at SB 60, noting it does not represent consensus among parties; and
agree to continue considering the matter at SB 61, taking into account the informal note, with a view to concluding consideration of the matter at CMA 6.
Modalities of the Dialogue on Implementing the Global Stocktake Outcomes: The purpose of this item was to discuss the modalities of the dialogue, which was established in the GST outcome, with the aim of operationalizing the dialogue at CMA 6. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Ricardo Marshall (Barbados) and Patrick Spicer (Canada), and took place on 5, 6, 8, 11, and 12 June.
Disagreements arose on whether the dialogue should consider all aspects of the GST outcome, a position shared by the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), the EU, ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), the US, NORWAY, and JAPAN; or whether it should consider finance, given that the paragraph establishing the dialogue was contained in a section on finance, a position shared by the AFRICAN GROUP and LMDCs. The INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC) and the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs) suggested a bridging proposal whereby the dialogue would follow up on all GST outcomes with a focus on finance and means of implementation.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.6), the SBI, inter alia:
takes note of the informal note prepared by the Co-Facilitators at SB 60, noting it does not represent consensus among parties;
agrees to continue consideration of the matter at SBI 61 with a view to concluding it at CMA 6;
invites parties to submit views on the modalities of the dialogue; and
requests the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis of submissions for consideration at SBI 61.
First Annual Dialogue on the Global Stocktake Informing the Preparation of Nationally Determined Contributions: This mandated event, which took place on 6 and 7 June, aimed to facilitate the sharing of good practices on how the GST’s outcomes will inform the preparation of parties’ next NDCs. Participants heard a series of presentations from parties and non-party stakeholders on the ways in which they integrated GST findings in their NDC process.
Participants reflected on challenges in synchronizing national legislative processes with the NDC update cycle, the value of sectoral climate targets, and the role of line ministries in implementing NDCs. The International Energy Agency highlighted findings from its new special report, “Strategies for Affordable and Fair Clean Energy Transitions,” including that speeding up the transition to clean energy technologies improves the affordability of energy and can relieve pressures on the cost of living.
Mitigation
Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme: This item considered parties’ views on the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP), including reflecting on its global dialogues and investment-focused events, the most recent of which took place in May 2024. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand), and took place on 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12 June.
Parties’ views significantly diverged on what should be included in the draft decision text to be prepared, especially on whether the decision should reflect and build on the mitigation-related elements of the GST outcome. The EIG, the EU, AOSIS, AILAC, and others supported this, while LMDCs and the ARAB GROUP opposed reflecting on the GST outcome, arguing that it was outside the work programme’s mandate to do so.
Parties discussed the improvement of global dialogues and investment-focused events, although several parties stated they would only engage on the topic with the assurance that other issues would also be discussed. Comments related to, among others:
using investment-related events to unlock funding, including blended finance and funding from multilateral development banks; and
conducting more inclusive dialogues, including by conducting regional dialogues, which the ARAB GROUP opposed.
The Co-Facilitators produced an informal note and draft conclusions under their own authority, but parties were unable to agree on whether to discuss them. The EU, EIG, AILAC, LDCs, and others suggested the Secretariat should produce a synthesis report on potential elements for a draft decision based on intersessional submissions. LMDCs, the ARAB GROUP, and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION opposed this.
During the closing plenary, SBI Chair Munir noted that parties were unable to come to an agreement. Applying rule 16 of the draft rules of procedure, the issue will be placed on the agenda for SB 61.
AOSIS expressed deep disappointment and frustration at the failure to adopt conclusions. She pointed to “tactics aimed at blocking the process” and underscored the need for a substantive decision to be adopted in Baku that reflects science, integrates the outcomes of the GST, and informs the preparation of 1.5°C-aligned NDCs.
The EU underscored that many developed and developing countries worked towards reaching agreement on the issue and supported the Co-Facilitators’ informal note as a basis for work at the next session. He cautioned there cannot be a good outcome in Baku without a substantial outcome on mitigation, calling upon the COP 28 Presidency and incoming COP 29 Presidency to do their utmost to break deadlocks and ensure that balance across all elements of the Paris Agreement is achieved.
The UMBRELLA GROUP considered it unacceptable that some parties refuse to engage with science and acknowledge the “historic” GST outcome.
EIG found it unacceptable to see some groups block progress, even in the form of a call for submissions. Emphasizing that mitigation cannot be “a taboo topic,” he said Baku needs to deliver on the 1.5°C goal.
LMDCs lamented negotiations conducted in bad faith, saying the process was “co-facilitator driven rather than party-driven.” He denounced that Annex I parties’ emissions are projected to increase in 2030 compared to 2020 and called out developed countries’ hypocrisy in discussions on means of implementation.
LDCs cautioned that the failure to make progress on the work programme jeopardizes the 1.5°C target and threatens vulnerable communities’ sustainable development chances. He invited all parties to reconsider their position and do better in Baku.
AILAC lamented that the MWP is not living up to its objective, underscoring the aim to enhance means of implementation with a sectoral perspective and establish links to the GST. She found it disheartening that some parties blocked even an intersessional call for submissions against a united majority of parties, which included a majority of developing countries representing all regions of the world.
The AFRICAN GROUP underscored it remains ready to engage in the work programme going forward, noting the need to inform scaled-up support for mitigation action, especially for expanded access to modern energy and clean cooking.
Guidance on Cooperative Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.2: Article 6 of the Paris Agreement enables voluntary cooperation among parties in the implementation of their NDCs. Article 6.2 relates to direct cooperation among parties bilaterally or multilaterally, through various approaches. Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) co-facilitated informal consultations on 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 June.
Discussions were informed by an informal note prepared by the SBSTA Chair, following which several iterations of draft decision text were prepared by the Co-Facilitators. Discussions focused on the “crunch issues” including authorizations, the agreed electronic format, sequencing of reviews and addressing inconsistencies, and registries.
On authorizations, parties considered the number of authorizations required; specifically, whether in addition to authorizing participation in the Article 6.2 cooperative approaches and the internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs), each individual cooperative approach requires authorization. A key divergence emerged regarding the revocation of authorizations, with some opposing any revocation and others supporting its permissibility before the first issuance of ITMOs.
On registries, parties discussed the extent of the interoperability of parties’ national registries and connection between the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the international registry. Several parties, including the EU, AFRICAN GROUP, AOSIS, and others, supported the ability to transfer authorized Article 6.4 emission reductions from the mechanism to the international registry, while others, including LMDCs and the ARAB GROUP, preferred limiting the connection to the ability to pull and view data and information on Article 6.4 emission reductions.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.8), the SBSTA, inter alia:
takes note of the work on common nomenclatures, concludes that there is no need for further discussion of this matter, deeming its consideration completed, and recommends that the CMA conclude its consideration of the matter;
requests the Secretariat to develop an initial list of common nomenclatures, as well as a process for requesting the establishment of and changes to common nomenclatures, and to report on progress in its annual report to the CMA;
takes note of the work on the modalities for reviewing confidential information, concludes there is no need for further discussion of this matter, deems its consideration thereof completed, and recommends that the CMA conclude its consideration of the matter;
requests the Secretariat to develop, publish, and implement the necessary administrative procedures, including a specific code of conduct for Article 6 technical expert review teams, for treating and reviewing information identified as confidential by participating parties, and to report on its progress in its annual report to the CMA;
takes note of the work on whether ITMOs could include emission avoidance, and agrees to continue consideration of this matter at SBSTA 68. It further notes that in the absence of further guidance by the CMA, the current guidance applies, and emission avoidance is not included in the current guidance; and
takes note of the draft text prepared for this sub-agenda item at SBSTA 60, notes that it does not represent consensus among parties, and agrees to continue consideration of the draft text at SBSTA 61 with a view to recommending a draft decisions for adoption at CMA 6;
requests the Secretariat to organize a hybrid workshop prior to SBSTA 61 to facilitate consideration of the draft text on matters related to authorization, the agreed electronic format, sequencing, application of first transfer, addressing inconsistencies, and the issues regarding registries.
Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Mechanism established by Paris Agreement Article 6.4: Article 6.4 relates to voluntary cooperation through a centralized market-based mechanism. Informal consultations were facilitated by Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan), and took place on 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, and 12 June.
Discussions were informed by an informal note prepared by the SBSTA Chair, following which several iterations of draft decision text were prepared by the Co-Facilitators. Discussions focused on, among others, authorizations and issues relating to registries. 
On authorizations, views diverged on whether mitigation contributions can be issued before authorization by the host party. EIG, AOSIS, the UK, AUSTRALIA, and others underlined that mitigation contributions can only be issued after authorization by the host country, while the AFRICAN GROUP, ARAB GROUP, LMDCs, BRAZIL, INDIA, and others opposed, stressing authorization can be provided at or after issuance.
Most parties supported the interoperability of the mechanism registry and parties’ national registries, with the AFRICAN GROUP and others also noting the need for interoperability with the international registry given that some countries will choose to use the latter in place of national registries. LMDCs and the ARAB GROUP opposed the ability to transfer Article 6.4 emission reductions from the mechanism registry to the international registry or national registries.
Parties also considered three new proposals relating to the share of proceeds for adaptation, transition of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) afforestation and reforestation activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism, and baseline methodologies. 
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.7), the SBSTA, inter alia:
takes note of the work on consideration of whether Article 6.4 activities could include emission avoidance and conservation enhancement and agrees to continue consideration of this matter at SBSTA 68;
notes that in the absence of further CMA guidance, the current rules, modalities, and procedures (RMPs) apply, and that emission avoidance is not included in these, and conservation enhancement is not a separate category of activity in the current RMPs; and
takes note of the draft text prepared for this sub-agenda item at SBSTA 60, noting that it does not represent consensus among parties, and agrees to continue consideration of the draft text at SBSTA 61 with a view to recommending a draft decisions for adoption at CMA 6; and
requests the Secretariat to organize a hybrid workshop prior to SBSTA 61, in conjuncture with the workshop on Article 6.2, to facilitate consideration of the draft text on matters related to authorization and the mechanism registry.
Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches referred to in Paris Agreement Article 6.8: Article 6.8 relates to climate cooperation between countries that does not involve any transfer or trade in the resulting mitigation outcomes. A contact group co-chaired by Kristin Qui (Trinidad and Tobago) and Jacqui Ruesga (New Zealand) considered this item on 4 and 8 June, among others. In addition to the contact group meetings, parties and non-party stakeholders also gathered in spin-off groups to discuss specific items, such as nature-based solutions.
The Secretariat provided an update on the development of the web-based platform, reporting that the party-specific section of the platform is now available. He highlighted upcoming outreach on how to access and publish NMAs on the platform.
Parties considered, among others, whether carbon pricing and other fiscal instruments, as well as nature-based solutions, should be considered as NMAs. 
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.4), the SBSTA, inter alia:
invites parties that have not yet notified the Secretariat of their Article 6.8 national focal points to do so to enable them to access the NMA Platform;
encourages parties to identify and submit their NMAs and to provide information on financial, technology, and capacity-building support available or provided for identifying, developing, and implementing NMAs on the platform; and
requests the Secretariat to, inter alia, add links to the Climate Technology Centre and Network and the Paris Committee on Capacity-building on the platform in recognition of their potential to provide technology and capacity-building support for identifying and developing NMAs.
Operation of the Clean Development Mechanism: Discussions were informed by a technical paper on the operations of the CDM registry, as well as a technical paper on the level of resources needed for the functioning of the processes and institutions under the CDM. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Alick Muvundika (Zambia) and Karoliina Anttonen (Finland) and held on, among others, 6, 7, and 8 June.
On resources, AOSIS, AILAC, and the UK supported discussing timelines for winding down the CDM’s operations and transferring resources to other processes, such as the Adaptation Fund and the Article 6.2 architecture. LMDCs opposed considering this until Article 6.4 is fully operational.
The EU and EIG, opposed by the AFRICAN GROUP and LMDCs, supported the administrative cancellation of certified emission reductions held in the pending account for non-payment of the share of proceeds.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.5), the SBSTA, inter alia:
requests the Secretariat to contact CDM project participants that have not paid their share of proceeds to confirm their intention to pay, and report on responses;
requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper on the further breakdown of necessary resources for the activities continuing under the CDM, and to include modalities for how available funds in the CDM trust fund are transferred to the Adaptation Fund and other potential areas of funding; and
agrees to continue consideration of the matter at SBSTA 61.
Emissions from Aviation and Maritime Transport: Informal consultations on this sub-item were co-facilitated by Martin Cames (Germany) and Pacifica F. Achieng Ogola (Kenya).
SBSTA Conclusions: The SBSTA agreed to continue consideration of this matter at SBSTA 61.
Adaptation
Global Goal on Adaptation: The Paris Agreement established the GGA as enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the 2°C/1.5°C temperature goals. Discussions at SB 60 aimed at operationalizing the work programme on GGA indicators, which was established in Dubai.
Informal consultations, which were co-facilitated by Tina Kobilšek (Slovenia) and Pedro Pedroso Cuesta (Cuba), took place on 3, 6, 8, 10, and 11 June, among others. Discussions centered on the engagement of experts in the indicator mapping process and criteria for indicator identification.
Parties debated the role of the Adaptation Committee (AC) in the indicator mapping process, with CANADA, the US, JAPAN, CHINA, and NORWAY proposing the AC lead the mapping process. The G-77/CHINA opposed, stating that the AC can contribute to and support the process, but not lead it.
EIG, AOSIS, LDCs, AILAC, and BRAZIL called for diversity and balanced regional representation of experts. AILAC emphasized the need for financial resources to support experts’ engagement. AILAC, GRUPO SUR, and EIG welcomed the recognition of the importance of engaging with Indigenous Peoples in all phases of the work under the GGA. AOSIS, AILAC, and LDCs supported the inclusion of information on data readiness for the list of GGA indicators.
Negotiations continued in informal informals and informal consultations until the very last day of SB 60, but parties eventually reached agreement on draft conclusions.
In the closing plenary, BOLIVIA lamented a “watered down” outcome and urged partners to “remain faithful to the principles of the Convention and its Paris Agreement.” The ARAB GROUP underscored that adaptation is key for developing countries and considered progress on the matter insufficient.
SB Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SB/2024/L.6), the SBs, inter alia:
recognize that means of implementation for adaptation are crucial, and also recognize that factors such as institutional arrangements, policies, data and knowledge, and inclusive governance are also crucial to enabling the implementation of adaptation action;
encourage the ethical and equitable engagement with Indigenous Peoples and local communities and application of traditional knowledge, the knowledge, wisdom and values of Indigenous Peoples, and local knowledge systems in implementing the GGA Framework;
invite submissions on existing indicators, including information on associated methodologies and data readiness for such indicators;
specify a list of criteria informing the mapping process, such as ability of the indicators to reflect regional, national, and local circumstances;
invite the AC to prepare a contribution to the compilation and mapping by identifying information on indicators reported by parties;
request the SB Chairs to convene technical experts to assist in the technical work under the work programme on GGA indicators, including reviewing and refining the compilation and mapping of existing indicators and, as needed, developing new indicators;
request the SB Chairs to ensure balance in terms of technical expertise, geographical representation, and gender of the experts, including experts from small island developing states (SIDS) and LDCs, and Indigenous knowledge holders;
request that the SB Chairs organize a hybrid workshop prior to CMA 6 (November 2024) for parties and technical experts to facilitate the refinement of the mapping process;
request the SB Chairs to prepare a compilation and mapping of existing indicators and areas potentially not covered by existing indicators in advance of the workshop;
request the Secretariat to publish the refined mapping of indicators as part of the workshop report prior to CMA 6;
request the Secretariat, with input from the technical experts, to prepare technical reports containing a list of proposed new indicators by May 2025 for consideration by SB 62 (June 2025);
request the SB Chairs to organize two further hybrid workshops, one to be held at SB 62 to take stock of the progress of work by technical experts, and another to be held between SB 62 and SB 63 to reflect on the final list of potential indicators to be agreed at CMA 7 (November 2025);
agree to consider additional work by the technical experts at SB 61 with a view to making a recommendation on this matter for consideration by CMA 6; and
agree to take stock of work under the work programme at SB 61, 62, and 63, with a view to informing the decision on the work programme at CMA 7.
Report of the Adaptation Committee and Review of the Progress, Effectiveness, and Performance of the Committee: Discussions under this item focused on the AC’s 2023 report. Informal consultations co-facilitated by SBI Chair Munir and SBSTA Chair Vreuls took place on 4 June, among others. Parties debated whether the AC’s annual report and the review should be considered as separate sub-items at future sessions.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2024/L.1), the SBs, inter alia:
recommend that COP 29 and CMA 6 take note of the AC’s 2023 report;
agree to continue consideration of the review of the AC’s progress, effectiveness, and performance at SB 61; and
agree to consider the annual report of the AC and the review of its progress, effectiveness, and performance under two separate sub-agenda items at SB 61.
Nairobi Work Programme on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change: Discussions focused on the progress review of the Nairobi Work Programme’s (NWP) activities and guidance on strengthening its role. Informal consultations co-facilitated by Camila Minerva Rodriguez Tavarez (Dominican Republic) and Morgan Whalen (Canada) took place on 7 and 12 June, among others. Parties debated whether recognizing the NWP’s contributions to the work programme on GGA indicators would prejudge the latter’s outcomes. Discussion also revolved around the need for collaboration between the NWP and the constituted bodies; the NWP’s level of activity across regions; and the need for further financial support to enable the implementation of NWP activities.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.3), the SBSTA, inter alia:
notes the reports on progress in implementing activities under the NWP and on activities, by region, between 2019-2023, and notes the information on these reports, including next steps and new activities as well as the indicative NWP workplan for 2024-2025; and
invites parties, NWP partner organizations, and other relevant organizations to provide financial and in-kind support for implementation of NWP activities.
National Adaptation Plans: In these discussions, parties reflected on the LDC Expert Group’s report on progress towards the formulation and implementation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Antwi Boasiako Amoah (Ghana) and Jens Fugl (Denmark) and took place on 8 June, among others. Parties discussed a number of issues, including the benefits of involving the private sector to promote and contribute to adaptation; stronger language recognizing the special needs and circumstances of SIDS and LDCs, and on gender-sensitive approaches to the implementation of NAPs; and text that recognizes the contribution of Indigenous Peoples to climate action.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.8), the SBI, inter alia:
emphasizes the importance of continuing the assessment of progress in formulating and implementing NAPs; and
agrees to continue further consideration of this agenda item at SBI 61, taking into consideration the informal note prepared at SBI 60, with a view to recommending a draft decision for adoption by COP 29.
Least Developed Countries: Informal consultations co-facilitated by Jens Fugl (Denmark) and Ephraim Shitima (Zambia) considered, among others, the report of the 45th meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) held in February 2024.
 SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.7), the SBI, among others:
recalls paragraph 46 of decision 1/CP.21 in relation to expediting support for LDCs to formulate and implement NAPs;
welcomes the rolling work programme of the LEG for 2024-2025;
welcomes the inclusion of activities related to the work programme on GGA indicators in the rolling work programme of the LEG for 2024-2025; and
urges developed countries to continue to mobilize financial support for the NAP process for the LDCs, and invites parties and relevant organizations to continue providing resources for supporting implementation of the LEG work programme.
Loss and Damage
Terms of Reference for the 2024 Review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu) and Meredith Ryder-Rude (US) and took place on 4, 6, 8, and 10 June, among others. Parties agreed to use the terms of reference (ToRs) of the 2019 review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) as basis for discussions.
Parties emphasized the need to reflect on the evolving institutional landscape on loss and damage, especially with regard to the Santiago Network and the new loss and damage fund. The G-77/CHINA supported a broad review of the WIM and its functions. The US, opposed by AILAC and GRUPO SUR, suggested considering how the functions of the WIM have been implemented, but not review the functions themselves. Parties also debated the G-77/CHINA’s proposal for the Secretariat to prepare a series of inputs to the review.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2024/L.4), the SBs, inter alia:
finalize the ToRs for the 2024 review of the WIM;
agree to undertake the review at SB 61 based on the ToRs and to forward the outcomes to the appropriate bodies;
invite submissions on gaps and challenges related to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the WIM, the usefulness of its outputs and activities, and ways to improve the implementation of its functions;
request the Secretariat to prepare a summary report of the views to serve as input to the 2024 review of the WIM;
request the Secretariat to prepare a background paper on: relevant decisions and mandates; institutional arrangements relating to loss and damage; progress of implementation of the workplan of the WIM ExCom and the plans of action of its expert groups, technical expert groups, and task force; progress of operationalization of the Santiago Network; and implementation of mandates and recommendations arising from the 2019 WIM review and relevant outcomes of the first GST;
request the Secretariat to organize an event in conjunction with SB 61 to provide inputs to the 2024 review; and
note the discussions at SB 60 relating to representation on the WIM Executive Committee.
Dialogue on Loss and Damage Funding: The objective of this mandated event, which convened on 6 and 7 June, was to reflect on how to enhance collaboration and coordination between loss and damage institutions. Parties’ comments related to, among others: hopes for a quick capitalization of the Fund; minimum allocation for SIDS and LDCs; a quantum on loss and damage funding under the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance; and tracking the delivery of loss and damage funding.
With regard to an upcoming high-level event on loss and damage finance, several called for: holding the dialogue before COP 29; fostering actual dialogue, rather than a series of statements; engagement with stakeholders such as the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Organization for Migration; and a follow-up process to leverage discussions.
Finance
Adaptation Fund: Discussions focused on matters related to membership in the Adaptation Fund Board in view of the Fund exclusively serving the Paris Agreement. At the outset of informal consultations co-facilitated by Ralph Bodle (Germany) and Amena Yauvoli (Fiji), parties agreed to postpone the consideration of the matter, but diverged on when to resume it.
The EU, SWITZERLAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, and NORWAY favored putting it on the agenda for SB 61 in Baku. Pointing to a possible resolution on the Article 6.4 mechanism in Baku, they emphasized the need to ensure the Fund is ready to receive shares of proceeds from the mechanism that might materialize before SBI 62.
The AFRICAN GROUP and the ARAB GROUP preferred postponing to SBI 62, emphasizing the matter should be reconsidered once a share of proceeds actually materializes, not when it is likely to materialize. CHINA supported this, adding it is unlikely shares of proceeds would materialize by then.
The Co-Facilitators consulted with the SBI Chair on the way forward. During the closing plenary, SBI Chair Munir noted parties could not reach agreement on the matter and that it will therefore be placed on the agenda for SBI 61, in accordance with rule 16 of the draft rules of procedure.
New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: COP 21 decided that, prior to 2025, the CMA shall set a NCQG from a floor of USD 100 billion per year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries. A dedicated ad hoc work programme was convened to facilitate this.
Work programme Co-Chairs Zaheer Fakir (UAE) and Fiona Gilbert (Australia) led discussions on 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11 June. At the outset, parties provided the Co-Chairs a mandate to streamline their input paper. The Co-Chairs revised their input paper twice, with various groups and parties pointing to elements they want to see removed, inserted, or reinserted.
With respect to substance, comments related to, among others:
ensuring the goal is fit for purpose and implementable, responsive to developing countries’ needs, and supports implementation of NDCs and NAPs, in line with the 1.5°C goal;
aligning the NCQG with the NDC and GST cycles;
the recipient base possibly reflecting vulnerability, macroeconomic circumstances, and regional equity;
possible burden sharing among developed countries, to enhance transparency and accountability; and
whether to address issues such as the contributor base and alignment of finance flows (Paris Article 2.1c).
Many parties identified areas where they considered there was some commonality, including on the need for better access and using the ETF as a basis for the transparency arrangements, but with updates to make it fit for purpose. The ARAB GROUP, CHINA, and others underlined the lack of proposals on the goal’s quantum and questioned how to discuss access and other issues without an idea of quantum. The AFRICAN GROUP called for clarity on provision and mobilization targets.
The work programme Co-Chairs will:
produce a summary of the meeting, including information on progress made;
start preparations for the third meeting of the work programme;
publish guiding questions for submissions ahead of the third meeting; and
prepare an input paper for the third meeting.
Tenth Technical Expert Dialogue under the Ad Hoc Work Programme on the NCQG: This mandated event took place on 3 June. Panel discussions focused on the goal’s level of ambition, qualitative elements, structure, and transparency arrangements. Participants shared a host of reflections, challenging one another’s positions on, among others:
developed countries’ contribution to the core of the goal;
adjusting the quantum of the goal according to the evolving needs of developing countries;
correlations between levels of development and enabling environments; and
safeguards meant to address the risk of corruption becoming a disproportionate barrier to access.
First Workshop under the Dialogue on Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c): Paris Agreement 2.1(c) defines the objective to make finance flows consistent with a pathway to low-GHG emissions and climate-resilient development. This mandated event took place on 12 and 13 June and focused on adaptation investments and the consistency of financial flows with a climate-resilient development pathway. Discussions highlighted, among others:
that climate-risk-informed approaches should not drive up the cost of capital for countries perceived as high-risk;
the role of central banks in fostering the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into financial decision making;
the use of direct cash incentives as part of corporate actors’ ESG engagement, for example to support agroforestry and intercropping;
lack of enactment of policy frameworks such as the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use;
reinvestment of carbon tax revenue to support industry transition and minimize backlash against climate policy;
using blended finance to overcome barriers related to high-risk perception and mobilize private finance; and
balancing the need for safeguards with that of speedy project implementation.
Breakout group discussions touched upon risks related to greenwashing, harmful finance flows, and stranded assets. Participants emphasized the need to make the best use of scarce public finance, ensuring it delivers change for the most vulnerable. They reflected on the opportunities and limitations of impact investment and how to go beyond a project-based approach. Delegates agreed that voluntary action by the private sector is not enough, and that regulation is needed, including to ensure transparency on finance flows and achieved impacts.
Discussions emphasized that governments will have to make difficult policy choices, with several underscoring that limited fiscal space makes it difficult for many developing countries to set up “carrots” to ensure social buy-in. They underscored the need to recognize individual countries and industries have different starting points and ensure that transition plans also address sectors such as agriculture and health.
Just Transition and Response Measures  
Just Transition Work Programme: This item aims to explore just transition pathways to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The first dialogue under the work programme took place on 2-3 June 2024. A contact group co-chaired by Marianne Karlsen (Norway) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) met on 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 June.
Discussions in contacts groups dealt with, inter alia:
ensuring more interaction and better inclusion of observers and non-party stakeholders in future dialogues;
how the topics for the second dialogue should be decided, with agreement that they should be decided by the SB Chairs “in a transparent and consultative manner”;
whether to hold future dialogues intersessionally or in coordination with SB meetings;
requesting constituted bodies to include information on progress towards integrating just transition into their processes in their reports; and
a proposal from the G-77/CHINA to establish a work plan for the work programme, with the US opposing.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2024/L.5), the SBs, among others:
welcome the first hybrid dialogue under the work programme, and encourage their Chairs to publish an informal summary of the discussions of each dialogue starting with the first;
reiterate that the topic of the second hybrid dialogue, which will be held before SB 61, will be decided by the SB Chairs upon consultation with parties, observers, and non-party stakeholders “in a transparent and consultative manner”;
emphasize working systematically to cover the elements of the work programme (delineated in paragraph 2 of Decision 3/CMA.5);
emphasize the importance of ensuring the effective and inclusive participation of parties and non-party stakeholders in the second dialogue, encouraging the Chairs to consider interactive engagement formats; and
agree to continue consideration of the matter at SB 61, taking note of the informal note prepared by the Co-Facilitators, views submitted via the submission portal, and the annual summary report on the dialogues, with a view to recommending a draft decision to CMA 6.
Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures under the Convention, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement: Delegates considered the Secretariat’s report on progress in implementing the workplan of the Forum and its Katowice Committee of Experts (KCI) with a view to inform the development of a five-year workplan. Contact group discussions, which were co-chaired by Xolisa Ngwadla (Botswana) and Maria Samuelsen (Denmark), convened on 5 and 12 June, among others.
The Secretariat reported on progress in implementing the workplan of the Forum and its KCI. Parties debated a new table of activities to be included in the five-year workplan, with the EU, UK, US, CANADA, and SWITZERLAND pointing out that the new table was not reflective of parties’ submissions. The US proposed deleting references to just transition as it is already covered under a different agenda item.
SB Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SB/2024/L.7), the SBs, inter alia:
welcome the Forum’s technical events on guidelines and policy frameworks to promote just transition and understanding of the positive and negative impacts of low- and zero-emission transportation technologies;
initiate the development of the five-year workplan of the Forum and its KCI in line with the Forum’s functions, work programme, and modalities, and considering policy issues of concern to parties; and
agree to continue work on this matter at SB 61, taking into account the non-paper prepared at SB 60, with a view to recommending a draft decision on the matter for consideration and adoption at COP 29, the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 19), and CMA 6.
Reporting

Reporting Tools under the Enhanced Transparency Framework: Discussions focused on the Secretariat’s technical paper on parties’ experience with the test version of the reporting tools under the ETF (FCCC/TP/2024/2). Informal consultations, co-facilitated by Daniela Romano (Italy) and Thiago Mendes (Brazil), took place on 6 June, among others. The Secretariat, in response to parties’ questions, explained that: user manuals will be available for all reporting tools once their final version is launched; instruction videos and technical documents on how to navigate the tools will be introduced; a support team has been established within the Secretariat that will address any technical issues reported by parties; and training sessions will be held in the Africa and Latin American and the Caribbean regions ahead of COP 29, as well as at COP 29.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.6), the SBSTA, inter alia:
welcomes the development of a test version of the ETF’s reporting tools, and the regular hands-on technical training workshops to demonstrate the functions of those reporting tools to national experts from parties;
considers the Secretariat’s technical paper on parties’ experience with the test version of the ETF reporting tools, including challenges encountered by developing countries in integrating the tools into their national inventory arrangements;
notes the Secretariat will make reporting tools available for parties by the end of June 2024;
emphasizes the importance of the Secretariat providing training and technical support to enhance the developing countries’ capacity to use the tools, in particular for LDCs and SIDS and particularly in the first six months after their release; and
notes that additional resources may be required for organizing the trainings and integrating the remaining features.
Technology and Capacity Building
Linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism: This item considers the potential links, collaboration, and cooperation between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Peter Govindasamy (Singapore) and Stephen Minas (Greece).
On 4 June, an in-session workshop considered what the Financial Mechanism can do to enhance support for the implementation of the outcomes of the technology needs assessments (TNA) process and Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) technical assistance. Ideas discussed included:
streamlining the process of converting these outcomes into bankable projects and enhancing efficiencies through a “plug and play” approach;
implementing strategies to enable National Designated Authorities to plan ahead and implement multi-year programmes rather than operating on a project-by-project basis; and
allocating adequate funds to support implementation of the TNAs and CTCN technical assistance outcomes.
SBI Conclusions: The SBI agreed to continue consideration of the matter at SBI 61, taking into account the draft text prepared at SB 60, with a view to recommending a draft decision for consideration and adoption by COP 29.
Capacity Building: Cristina Carreiras (EU) and Nathalie Flores González (Dominican Republic) co-facilitated informal consultations on 6 June, among others, during which parties considered draft decision text on the second review of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building under the CMA.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.2), the SBI, inter alia:
reiterates that needs and gaps remain in addressing the priority issues identified in the framework for capacity building in developing countries and noted that further efforts are needed to address current and emerging capacity-building gaps and needs related to developing countries’ implementation of the Paris Agreement;
recommends a draft decision on the terms of reference for the fifth comprehensive review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building in developing countries under the Convention for consideration and adoption by COP 29 (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.2/Add.1); and
recommends draft decisions on the second review of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building for consideration and adoption by COP 29 and the CMA 6 (November 2024) (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.2/Add.2 and Add.3).
Other Issues
Research and Systematic Observation: The annual research dialogue convened at the June session of the SBSTA provides a space to convey research findings and lessons learned from activities undertaken by regional and international research programmes and organizations. It also serves to discuss needs for climate change research and research-related capacity building, particularly in developing countries. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Patricia Nying’uro (Kenya) and Frank McGovern (Ireland). Parties met on, among others, 5, 7, 10, 11, and 12 June. During discussions, parties considered, among others:
whether to acknowledge the organization of the 16th meeting of the research dialogue held on 4 June, with the ARAB GROUP and CHINA opposing and stating that the organization and the choice of topics of the dialogue did not reflect a party-driven process;
whether to invite the IPCC to take into account, in determining its future products and assessment cycles, work under the Convention and the Paris Agreement, with AOSIS, the EU, US, and others in favor, and SAUDI ARABIA and KUWAIT opposing;
whether to specify research needs, such as related to: constraints to climate-resilient and sustainable development above 1.5°C; adaptation limits; economic and non-economic loss and damage; climate attribution; non-carbon dioxide GHGs other than methane; the implications of different emission metrics in informing mitigation policies and the alignment of the financial system; and
whether and how to capture the scientific community’s response to these research needs.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.9), the SBSTA, among others:
encourages the IPCC to enhance inclusivity and regional representation in its seventh assessment cycle;
takes note, with appreciation, of the 16th meeting of the research dialogue;
notes the discussion on scientific advances and knowledge gaps, as well as on research needs and research capacity-building needs, and encourages parties and the scientific community to take action to address climate-related research gaps and needs, including by strengthening research capacity at the regional level, inclusivity, and scientific cooperation; and
invites parties and relevant organizations to submit views on possible themes for the 17th meeting of the research dialogue, to be held in conjunction with SBSTA 62, and encourages its Chair to identify themes for the dialogue “in a consultative and inclusive manner”; and
encourages its Chair to consider inviting the scientific community to present on how research needs and gaps are being addressed.
During the closing plenary, CHINA stressed the importance of following the appropriate rules and procedures in negotiations, and noted his concern and serious reservations about only receiving the conclusions text minutes before its introduction in plenary. Noting that the theme selection for the research dialogue was “problematic,” CHILE expressed his concern that conclusions do not specify research needs. Expressing their disappointment, AOSIS argued that the process is “increasingly struggling to reflect the best available science.” LMDCs expressed their “deep disappointment” and concern at certain parties’ refusal to include the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities (CBDR-RC) in the discussions. The AFRICAN GROUP and UMBRELLA GROUP expressed their concerns about the negotiation process.
Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform: Discussions focused on reviewing the outcomes and activities under the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) and the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP), including the workplan of the LCIPP for 2025-2027, and progress related to the representation of local communities.
Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Clement Yow Mulalap (Micronesia) and Kajsa Fernström Nåtby (Sweden) and took place on 5, 7, and 10 June, among others. Discussions centered on: strengthening the LCIPP and mainstreaming its work in the UNFCCC process; budgetary implications of the Secretariat’s activities on the LCIPP; and recognition of both formal and informal language interpretations at FWG meetings and mandated events under the LCIPP. Parties also debated whether to invite the CMA to decide that the FWG shall also serve the Paris Agreement.
SBSTA Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.1), the SBSTA recommends a draft decision for COP 29 that, inter alia:
acknowledges the role and contributions of Indigenous Peoples and of local communities in nature stewardship and climate leadership and the disproportionate effects of climate change on them;
welcomes the progress of the FWG in facilitating implementation of the LCIPP functions and the report of the FWG including the draft workplan of the LCIPP for 2025-2027;
decides to continue the mandate of the FWG;
encourages parties to actively engage under the LCIPP and in the meetings of the FWG;
invites parties to provide simultaneous interpretation into languages other than UN official languages at meetings of the FWP and mandated events under the LCIPP and requests the Secretariat to make necessary arrangements for accommodating such additional simultaneous interpretation;
requests the FWG to report on the outcomes of its work, including activities under the workplan for 2025-2027, to propose recommendations on the scope and function of the LCIPP, and to prepare a draft workplan for LCIPP for 2028-2031 for consideration by COP 32 through SBSTA 66;
decides the next review of the FWG will take place in 2027 and requests the SBSTA to conduct the review at SBSTA 66 with a view to adopt a decision at COP 32; and
invites parties and organizations to provide financial support for LCIPP’s implementation of its functions.
Joint Work on Implementation of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food Security: Discussion focused on the operationalization of the joint work and development of the dedicated online portal. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Una May Gordon (Belize) and Annela Anger-Kraavi (EU) and took place on 4, 7, 8, 10, and 11 June, among others. Parties discussed possible workshop topics for the roadmap of the joint work, which included, among others: means of implementation, including finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building; and integration of agriculture in food systems in NDCs, NAPs, and long-term strategies, Technology Needs Assessments, Technology Action Plans and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans. The Secretariat noted the online portal will be ready by the end of June 2024 and launched at SB 61.
SB Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2024/L.2), the SBs, inter alia:
invite relevant international organizations to submit information on their activities related to the joint work every year, and request the Secretariat to take this into account in preparing the annual synthesis report and make this annual report available for consideration at the first SB session each year, starting in 2025;

agree to continue consideration of this matter at SB 61.
The annexed roadmap defines a timeline for work until SB 65. The topic of the first workshop, to be held between SB 61 and SB 62 is: systemic and holistic approaches to implementation of climate action on agriculture, food systems and food security, understanding, cooperation and integration into plans. The topic of the second workshop, to be held between SB 63 and SB 64 is: progress, challenges, and opportunities related to identifying needs and accessing means of implementation for climate action in agriculture and food security, including sharing of best practices.
Gender: The SBI initiated the final review of the implementation of the enhanced Lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan, starting with consideration of the work programme (FCCC/SBI/2024/11). Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Angela Ebeleke Yoka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Marc-André Lafrance (Canada).
Delegates could not conclude the review as planned.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.9), the SBI agrees to continue consideration of this matter at SBI 61 on the basis of the draft text prepared at SB 60 with a view to recommending a draft decision thereon for consideration and adoption by COP 29.
In-Session Workshop on Progress, Challenges, Gaps, and Priorities in Implementing the Gender Action Plan and on Future Work to be Undertaken on Gender and Climate Change: In this three-day-long mandated event, discussions touched upon, inter alia:
the pervasive “siloing” of gender within programmes;
moving from creating plans to ensuring implementation;
gender-disaggregated data;
capturing the “diverse realities of people” by adopting an intersectional lens across the action plan; and
enhancing linkages and complementarities with processes such as those related to the new collective quantified goal on climate finance and the GGA.
Action for Climate Empowerment: The SBI considered the Secretariat’s 2023 summary report on progress in implementing activities under the work programme on Action for Climate Empowerment (FCCC/SBI/2023/16). Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Pemy Gasela (South Africa) and Arne Riedel (Germany). Parties were unable to conclude their consideration of the matter at SBI 59 and could not conclude it at SB 60 either.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions, the SBI agrees to continue consideration of this matter at SBI 61, taking into account the informal note prepared by the Co-Facilitators at SB 60.  
Annual Dialogue on Ocean and Climate Change: During this mandated event, which took place on 11 and 12 June, speakers presented case studies, best practices, and challenges related to ocean and climate action at the regional and national level. This was followed by interactive breakout sessions and a final wrap-up in plenary. Discussions touched upon, among others:
mechanisms to track the extent and distribution of nutrients and plastic pollution in the ocean;
the recently adopted Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement);
approaches such as ecosystem-based adaptation, nature-based solutions, integrated coastal zone management, and adaptive management;
mangrove restoration and nature-based seawalls, which protect against erosion, sequester carbon, and serve as habitat for many species;
the need to scale up options to implement ocean-based renewable energy and decarbonize the maritime industry;
the role of Indigenous Peoples and coastal communities, and the need to protect their rights by implementing free, prior, and informed consent; and
the importance of viewing the ocean as intrinsically valuable, not only as a solution to climate change.
Expert Dialogue on Children and Climate Change: This mandated event took place on 4 June and highlighted the disproportionate impacts of climate change on children, including with regard to: physical and mental health; access to essential services such as food, water, and sanitation; the disruption of education; and cultural impacts.
Expert Dialogue on Mountains and Climate Change: SBSTA Chair Vreuls opened this day-long mandated event by highlighting its objectives: to enhance understanding of climate change impacts on mountains and downstream communities, showcase solutions contributing to the resilience of mountain ecosystems, and discuss ways to accelerate action. Speakers reflected on, among others:
the importance of mountain regions in the global water cycle and the increasing dependence of lowland populations on mountain water runoff;
impacts such as glacier loss, reduction of snow cover, and flood events;
the irreversible changes in mountain ecosystems that will result from overshooting 1.5°C of global warming;
data and research gaps, such as on mountain medicinal plants and invasive alien species;
the use of citizen science, for example to map water springs;
Indigenous Peoples’ intricate relationship with mountain ecosystems in terms of cultural and spiritual practice, as well as diets; and
the importance of transboundary collaboration to accelerate adaptation efforts.
Arrangements for Intergovernmental Meetings: This agenda item considers the organization of COP 29; potential hosts for COP 31, COP 32, and COP 33; and the Secretariat’s papers on enhancing the effectiveness of the process (FCCC/SBI/2024/8, FCCC/TP/2024/5, FCCC/SBI/2024/INF.4, FCCC/TP/2024/1). SBI Chair Munir chaired the contact group discussions which took place on 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 June, among others.
On the organization of COP 29, the EU, EIG, US, CANADA, and NORWAY called for language on upholding human rights. The COP 29 Presidency highlighted staff training on the code of conduct and the creation of a dedicated protest zone.
With regard to the provisional agendas for meetings in Baku, discussions focused on, among others: the placement of the item on the dialogue on implementing GST outcomes under matters related to the GST or to finance; considering the report from the annual dialogue on how the GST informs the preparation of NDCs; considering the seventh review of the Financial Mechanism under both the COP and CMA; and having an item on the special needs and circumstances of Africa.
The EU, LDCs, UK, and CANADA, opposed by the LMDCs, ARAB GROUP, and CHINA, proposed to cluster certain issues under umbrella items. The EU, EIG, and JAPAN supported a stronger role of the Bureau in the preparation of provisional agendas. NORWAY and the UK supported multi-annual agenda planning to ensure better alignment with the cycles of certain mandates.
The US, UK, and AUSTRALIA lamented the Secretariat’s decision not to provide a virtual platform at SB 60. The EU, CANADA, NORWAY, and MEXICO requested that host country agreements be made public. The WESTERN EUROPEAN AND OTHERS GROUP (WEOG) indicated they hope to reach an agreement on a regional nomination for the host of COP 31 by COP 29, with Australia and Türkiye reiterating their candidacies.
On observer engagement, BRAZIL requested that greater representation be secured for observers from developing country organizations and suggested specific provisions for observers from incoming Presidencies. SWITZERLAND warned that requiring fees for developed country organizations could unintentionally exclude them from the process. Noting challenges with resourcing existing trust funds, the EU and US objected to establishing a new trust fund for developing country observer participation.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.3), the SBI, inter alia:
takes note of the document on arrangements for intergovernmental meetings prepared for SB 60;
notes that the Presidents of COP 31, 32, and 33 would come from WEOG, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific, respectively;
emphasizes that the Secretariat and hosts of sessions and mandated events should make logistical arrangements that will facilitate the inclusive and effective participation of parties and observers, including timely issuance of visas; availability of affordable accommodation; a safe and secure conference venue for all; and ease of access to the venue;
notes with concern the difficulties experienced by some delegates in obtaining visas to enable them to attend sessions of the governing and subsidiary bodies, and mandated events convened at the seat of the Secretariat;
requests the Secretariat and future hosts of sessions and mandated events to enhance virtual access;
emphasizes the importance of ensuring that participants can exercise their human rights without fear of intimidation and repercussions;
notes that host country agreements for COP sessions should be made publicly available;
invites submissions on increasing efficiency in the UNFCCC process with a view to continue consideration thereof at SBI 62; and
highlights steps for enhancing observer engagement, including encouraging parties to consider improving time management of meetings with a view to enabling the UNFCCC’s nine constituencies to deliver short interventions at meetings on agenda items related to observer engagement.
Administrative, Financial, and Institutional Matters: This agenda item considered the report on the Secretariat’s 2023 activities and financial performance (FCCC/SBI/2024/9), 2022-2023 budget performance (FCCC/SBI/2024/7/Add.1), status of contributions (FCCC/SBI/2024/INF.5), and Secretariat’s 2024-2025 work programme (FCCC/SBI/2024/INF.1), among others, with a view to recommending draft decisions on these matters for consideration and adoption at COP 29, CMP 19, and CMA 6.
Contact group discussions, co-chaired by Gabriela Blatter (Switzerland) and Zita Wilks (Gabon), took place on 7 and 10 June, among others. The UK noted the lack of consultation with parties before the Secretariat canceled the regional climate weeks and virtual access to SB 60. The ARAB GROUP requested: availability of the UN Board of Auditors’ report, consideration of revenue-generating options, and clarification of the Executive Secretary’s travel expenditures. Parties debated the suggestion to have the Secretariat present potential cost implications of decisions before they are agreed.
SBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.4), the SBI recommends a draft decision for COP 29 which, inter alia:
urges parties that have not made contributions in full to the core budget to do so, and expresses concern about the high level of outstanding contributions, which has affected the implementation of activities;
expresses concern about activities and events being canceled due to unpredictability of contributions to the trust fund for supplementary activities, while some elements of the Secretariat’s work programme were substantially increased;
urges parties to further contribute to the trust funds for participation in the UNFCCC and for supplementary activities to ensure a high level of implementation of the Secretariat’s work programme;
requests the Secretariat to significantly improve the transparency of its budget management process including by preparing quarterly reports on the extent to which the core and supplementary budgets are funded, starting in the first quarter of 2025 at the latest;
requests the Secretariat to prepare an information document after each session of the COP that shows the additional activities mandated at the session and their respective cost implications;
expresses concern about the high number of unimplemented recommendations from the UN Board of Auditors, and urges the Executive Secretary to immediately implement the standing recommendations; and
encourages the Secretariat to enhance clarity on the nature of activities, whether mandated or not, in documents on the programme budget for the biennium 2026–2027.
In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2024/L.5), the SBI recommends a draft decision for CMP 19, mirroring the draft decision for COP 29.
Cooperation with other International Organizations: During its opening plenary, the SBSTA noted the report (FCCC/ SBSTA/2024/Inf.1).
Closing Plenary
During the closing plenary on Thursday, 13 June, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell underscored that business-as-usual is a recipe for failure and that success requires getting more serious about bridging divides. He stressed the need to make progress outside the UNFCCC process, especially on finance.
SBI Chair Munir stated that real progress is only possible through dialogue and engagement with one another. He noted agreement on critical issues, such as on adaptation and just transition, among others. However, he also pointed out the failure to make progress in other areas such as mitigation. He encouraged everyone to work together in Baku so that parties can deliver on the promises they made to the world and to future generations.
The G-77/CHINA pointed out that the NCQG must be in accordance with the Convention and the Paris Agreement, with developed countries fulfilling their commitments to developing countries based on the principles of equity and CBDR-RC.
The EU expressed disappointment at the outcome of the MWP, stating that there cannot be a good outcome at COP 29 if it does not include a substantial outcome on mitigation. He welcomed the progress on the NCQG but pointed out that, to make it work, there is a need to strengthen the broader financial architecture, create conditions to catalyze investments, and ensure finance is delivered where it is needed and at the scale required.
The UMBRELLA GROUP lamented the lack of progress in the MWP and some parties’ attempts to block progress. They welcomed the recognition of the research dialogue and assessment of the IPCC’s role in the process, stating that best available science is the backbone of countries’ best response to the climate crisis.
The EIG reiterated its call for a transparent and party-driven process where parties trust the facilitators to streamline and prepare the text and for parties to express their agreement or disagreement, but noted that some parties directly engage with the Secretariat to stall progress in some work programmes. They hoped to finalize the operationalization of Article 6.2 and 6.4 and to build on the work programme on gender in Baku.
The BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA (ALBA) stressed its commitment to defending the principle of CBDR-RC and their right to development. They emphasized that 2024 is the year of finance, pointing out the need for greater funding for adaptation implementation and ensuring that transition is truly just.
AOSIS called out parties for their slow response and lack of progress in implementing the outcomes of the first GST. They pointed out that competing agenda items and the lack of time and space to work on a number of thematic areas would make it difficult for them to negotiate in Baku, given their limited resources. Noting the critical importance of adaptation for SIDS, they stressed that their full participation in the process is key to keeping the 1.5°C goal alive.
The AFRICAN GROUP lamented the trend of a lack of appetite to discuss means of implementation, noting pronouncements about urgency of action are not accompanied by actual action. Stressing that adaptation is about the dignity of people, they urged parties to step up their commitment to adaptation, and, lamenting efforts to reinterpret mandates, stressed the MWP must not create new targets or goals.
LMDCs pointed to unbalanced progress with hours spent discussing some issues, such as mitigation, while ignoring others such as means of implementation. They called for COP 29 to deliver on past failed promises about finance and, among other things, define a quantum for the NCQG.
LDCs regretted the challenges that arose from the increased number of agenda items and mandated events, the lack of virtual participation, and visa issues. Noting progress on the GST, they expressed hope this would guide discussions in Baku. They urged countries to respect and be guided by the principles of the Convention and Paris Agreement in defining the NCQG.
The ARAB GROUP underscored the importance of adaptation and, urging adherence to the Convention’s principles, especially CBDR-RC, called for implementing and reflecting these in all negotiated decisions.
AILAC highlighted that more than 80% of climate action in the group’s countries is financed through debt, which comes at great cost to them. They urged implementation of all calls in the GST decision in an integrated manner, and called for the Troika’s support in achieving this.
The Coalition for Rainforest Nations stressed emission avoidance activities must not be eligible under Paris Agreement Articles 5.2 (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), 6.2, or 6.4, noting the need for robust environmental integrity and comprehensive carbon accounting to ensure effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.
BASIC stressed that the NCQG must be delivered on a solid and effective basis, based on grants and public finance. They deplored what they described as an attempt to dilute climate finance obligations, and expressed concern at repeated attempts by some developed country parties to “undermine the Convention” by changing the mandate of the MWP.
GRUPO SUR stressed the need for discussions on Article 6 to conclude in Baku. They further noted that any new goal agreed under NCQG discussions should not increase the debt burden of developing countries.
The MOUNTAIN PARTNERSHIP highlighted the success of the Expert Dialogue on Mountains and Climate, noting the research gap on mountain-related issues. She called on the IPCC to dedicate one chapter of its upcoming seventh assessment report to mountains, and reiterated her request for an annual mountain dialogue under the UNFCCC.
BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY NGOs noted the private sector’s role in scaling up climate finance. They called for the right enabling environment for businesses that reflects an ambitious NCQG, tools to scale up mitigation, and identification of key barriers to mitigation across all sectors.
ENVIRONMENTAL NGOs called for developed countries to step up to their responsibilities and phase out fossil fuels. They stressed that carbon finance is not climate finance and the reparations owed to developing countries are in trillions, which must go to those on the frontlines who suffer the most from climate change impacts.
FARMERS welcomed the decision on the joint work on agriculture and food security and looked forward to engaging in the workshops. They stressed the need for an ambitious NCQG and called for timely and appropriate climate finance for small-scale farmers as they are solution providers to the climate crisis, particularly on food security.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ ORGANIZATIONS applauded the decisions on the LCIPP and joint work on agriculture and food security, but stressed that free, prior, and informed consent should be reflected in all the work streams undertaken in Baku. They also called for support on robust sustainable development tools for NMAs and direct access to climate finance for Indigenous Peoples.
RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NGOs, in acknowledging the critical contribution of the IPCC, encouraged parties to use best available science in developing their NDCs. They urged parties to explore mitigation and adaptation solutions and to fund diverse scientific perspectives, which reflect a rapidly evolving research landscape that can help catalyze a just and sustainable future.
TRADE UNION NGOs expressed disappointment at the outcome of the just transition work programme, saying they expected that the time in Bonn should have been used to share experiences and best practices to develop ambitious NDCs. They pointed out the lack of progress on the NCQG, and stressed this must integrate the principle of just transition.
WOMEN AND GENDER lamented the slow pace of the gender work programme and the delay in action on other work streams, resulting in loss of faith in the multilateral space. They called for the global community to protect women’s rights and to deliver on gender equality in Baku. They stressed that climate finance must be delivered on scale and be gender responsive.
YOUTH NGOs expressed disappointment at the negotiations that “left people behind” and did not allow for civil society to intervene in a meaningful way, mentioning as an example that only three children were present in the children’s dialogue. They demanded more ambitious NDCs, fossil fuel phase-out, and outcomes that address finance gaps.
Conclusion of the Session: The SBSTA and SBI then adopted their respective draft meeting reports (FCCC/SBSTA/2024/L.2 and FCCC/SBI/2024/L.1). The meeting was gaveled to a close at 1:06 am on Saturday, 14 June 2024.
A Brief Analysis of the 2024 Bonn Climate Conference
As the first week of the 2024 June Climate Conference got underway, participants witnessed a telling metaphor: the river Rhine, already dangerously high, began rising, threatening to burst its banks. It seemed appropriate for a process that is trying to rein in a dangerously warming world, and whose recent decision on the Paris Agreement’s first Global Stocktake (GST) is meant to inspire the course-correction needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C.
The June meetings of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)’s Subsidiary Bodies (SBs) are not meant to be groundbreaking. They are supposed to pave the way for the governing body meetings in November, where decisions are actually made. Yet even by this relatively humble standard, it was difficult to pin down what progress—if any—was achieved this time. Much like a river, the two-week long meeting seemed to flow nowhere and everywhere at once. Parties clashed on substantive ideas and on process alike, with visions colliding so intensely that entire agenda items sank under the water.
This brief analysis will examine parties’ attempts to rein in a seemingly ever-more complex process and steer the world onto a Paris Agreement-compatible pathway.
A Process Trying to Stay Afloat
If the flow of a river is important to flood prevention, so too is its volume. The same applies to the UNFCCC process. As interest in climate change and the process has grown, so has attendance and programming at UNFCCC events: over 8,000 people registered for the SBs, and the two weeks saw a record number of 30 mandated events. “The process has really ballooned,” one seasoned observer commented. “And it’s clearly become too much for delegations and the Secretariat alike.”
Delegates discussing arrangements for intergovernmental meetings made it clear that parties’ capacity to follow multiple simultaneous negotiating streams and meet the ever-increasing demand for submissions and participation in intersessional workshops is compromised—especially for smaller delegations, such as those from least developed countries (LDCs).
But delegates were not the only ones showing the strain. The past few years have seen the UNFCCC Secretariat becoming increasingly vocal about the fact that parties’ financial contributions are not matching the workload that increases with every meeting—and the meeting in Bonn was no exception to this trend, as the read-out of newly agreed work’s budgetary implications showed during the closing plenary.
Budgetary constraints are also what the Secretariat highlighted to motivate its last-minute decision not to offer virtual coverage of the meeting, save for plenaries and events for which remote access was mandated. This decision was decried by many who have grown accustomed to the virtual participation opportunity ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some saw it as a strategic move to put pressure on parties, others noted that a funding-starved Secretariat cannot offer services it cannot afford.
How do you keep an ever-growing process inclusive and adequately resourced? Possible answers came from all sides but left no one satisfied. Brazil lauded the value of detailed annotations to the agendas, which lay out the issues to be addressed under the different agenda items, as this facilitates participation both for parties and observers. Not much else found agreement. Some called for streamlining meeting agendas, but others worried that any clustering of items under broader headings could undermine the party-driven nature of the process and frame discussions in a way that is not agreeable to all.
Many sighed in relief when they heard that the incoming Conference of the Parties (COP) 29 Presidency has no intention for the meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, to match the (exorbitant) participant numbers of COP 28 (over 61,000) or even COP 27 (over 33,000). Yet, who determines whose participation is meaningful and where exactly balance in representation lies? Various parties floated ideas, including quotas, but none stuck.
The June meetings gave no real answers about how to stem the tide, but it is clear that the process will need solutions sooner rather than later. These issues are not just procedural: they contribute to process-fatigue and have a real impact on the public perception of how equitable and fit-for-purpose the UNFCCC really is.
Up the Creek… Without a Draft Text
Every droplet in a river is important, but a wise boater knows to read the water. Unfortunately, the strong undercurrents of discussions in Bonn left parties’ boats floundering, rather than sailing smoothly.
The GST decision acknowledged that parties are not on track to achieve the 1.5°C goal, and sets outs a number of calls for action for parties to contribute to the needed reduction in global emissions. Parties are now supposed to reflect on their response to these calls.
In Bonn, they had two main opportunities to do so: the discussions on the mitigation work programme (MWP) and those aimed at fleshing out the modalities of a work programme for implementing the GST outcome. The idea is that these discussions inform the preparation of the next round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), due in February 2025.
Perhaps the greatest frustration for many participants was the lack of progress under the MWP—a process meant to “urgently” scale up both ambition and implementation. Yet, its informal consultations devolved into spats about whether parties even could discuss substantive ways to scale up mitigation. The Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs) blocked any attempt to discuss anything but revisions on the format for the work programme’s global dialogue. “I have never seen such bad-faith negotiating,” one outraged developed country delegate said.
Both in the discussions under the MWP and in relation to the GST dialogue, the urgency of the timeline was drowned in a flood of back-and-forth arguments over mandate. Observers saw age-old hackles unfold over parties’ respective contribution to the joint cause of emissions reduction and how to ensure means of implementation to enable or enhance action.
The Environmental Integrity Group was clear in rebutting the idea that the GST is a “menu of options,” noting it calls for efforts by all. The Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC) was especially intent on bridging these divides: the group championed the idea for the GST dialogue to follow up on all aspects of the GST, with a focus on means of implementation. AILAC clarified that a majority of developing countries, representing all regions, were keen to see the MWP live up to its potential. The African Group also professed its interest in discussing opportunities for scaled-up investment in mitigation action, pitching its longtime priorities of enhancing energy access and clean cooking.
Finance is as much of a cause of stalled progress as it is a victim, it seems. Baku is meant to be “a finance COP.” However, the discussions held in Bonn raised doubts over whether parties will even agree on the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance.
Developed countries have yet to bring concrete numbers to the table. In the absence of proposals on the magnitude of public finance provision, developing countries are reluctant to engage on other possible layers of the goal, especially broader finance flow alignment (Paris Agreement 2.1c)—an issue that delegates only timidly engaged with in Bonn during a dedicated dialogue.
Small island developing states and least developed countries were clearly at wits end, caught between developed countries’ and emerging economies’ fights over an expanded donor base and criteria for recipient eligibility and allocation. “If we’re meant to set a new goal in Baku, we’re clearly up the creek without a paddle,” one observer diagnosed.
Discussions on research and systematic observation were also unequivocally fraught. Amid objections by LMDCs and the Arab Group, parties could not agree to extend a formal invitation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to consider how best to align its work with the GST cycle. For seasoned delegates, this in itself was not surprising. What was more astonishing was the lack of agreement over identifying parties’ research needs and attempting to keep track of how the scientific community responds.
Experts will have their chance to contribute to the process soon enough though: parties did agree to launch substantive work on adaptation indicators and have milestones in place for parties and experts, including Indigenous Peoples, to fine tune the mapping process. While this is not exactly a win, considering that the Global Goal on Adaptation was established in the Paris Agreement nearly a decade ago, it does move things along towards substantive engagement on adaptation progress.
Some agenda items did manage to stay afloat despite the turbulent waters. For two weeks, negotiators working on approaches for voluntary cooperation in the implementation of NDCs (Paris Agreement Article 6) buckled down and pushed hard to achieve some kind of consensual agreement that would at least advance discussions towards possible agreement in Baku.
In the end, they agreed to postpone further consideration of emission avoidance and conservation enhancement to 2028 and maintain the status quo until then. While this does not bring the operationalization of Article 6 any closer, it contributes to securing its environmental integrity. It may also help give parties head space to focus on “crunch” issues, such as how countries should authorize the transfer of mitigation outcomes under Article 6.2 or whether countries without national registries will be able to use the international registry to record and transfer mitigation outcomes. If the progress feels slow, it is at least meaningful. “Article 6 is a long way off from being fully functional,” one tired negotiator confessed, “but we won’t start from nothing in Baku. That’s something. And we managed to squeeze in an intersessional workshop.”
Reading the Rapids on the Way to Baku
Delegates in Bonn didn’t have to get their feet wet—at least, not yet. Just as the water reached the boardwalk, the river receded before the final days of the conference. But it left questions along the high-water mark.
The Secretariat has mobilized partners across the UN system and beyond to support parties in preparing their first biennial transparency reports (BTRs) under the Paris Agreement’s reporting framework. Andorra and Guyana led the way, but it is not clear how many parties will respond to the incoming COP 29 Presidency’s call to submit these BTRs before Baku.
What will the last scheduled meeting for the NCQG deliver in terms of concrete textual progress? What role will the Azeri Presidency play in bringing parties together? And how will it respond to the clear stand expressed by some parties that there will be no successful outcome to COP 29 without progress on mitigation and 1.5°C alignment of NDCs?
Whatever progress comes before Baku, it will emerge from discussions in back rooms and workshops, G7 meetings between leaders, and ministerial dialogues. In the meantime, the June session has made it clear to all who attended that, when it comes to climate action, the line between sink and swim has never been finer."
