A seasoned observer held out hope for an ambitious update to the Sunnylands Statement issued a few weeks ahead of the conference, but feared the balance might “tip the other way.” Given that language in US-China bilateral agreements often end up in texts, as with language around coal in Glasgow, it could prove a decisive last-ditch move."

Several developing country groups supported the current text which authorizes the transfer of USD 45 million to the Adaptation Fund. Some developed countries proposed that funds should also be transferred to Article 6, specifying that USD 8.8 million has been identified as the shortfall needed to support development of the Article 6 architecture and proposed transferring this amount. One developing country group opposed any transfer to Article 6 and called for all residual resources to be transferred to the Adaptation Fund.

Many denounced the lack of a clear reference to fossil fuel phaseout, weak language on coal and methane, and the loopholes associated with so-called “transitional fuels,” which the decision says “can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security.” Others found the reference to these specific global efforts too prescriptive and underscored the bottom-up and nationally-determined nature of the Paris Agreement. Nevertheless, the decision is celebrated as the “beginning of the end of fossil fuels.”"

All action is situated within the 1992 Convention’s principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR). The Agreement cements the “nationally determined” approach articulated by the Copenhagen Accord. Countries’ pledges contribute to reaching global temperature, net-zero emissions, adaptation, and finance goals. The Agreement is meant to be dynamic through the “ratchet up mechanism,” beginning with the Global Stocktake (GST), itself mimicking older reviews of progress, then continued by Paris Agreement mechanisms to submit progressively more ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs). In Dubai, the first Stocktake concluded. Parties now had to confront the creature they created."

Throughout the negotiations, the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs) warned against language that tread dangerously close to re-writing the Paris Agreement itself.

Exactly how was up to negotiators in Dubai. They wrestled to arrive at a common narrative of the past. No one could hide from the ugly results of the 18-month technical phase of the GST. Emissions are rising above what should be happening under the existing NDCs, which themselves are insufficient to keep global temperature rise below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C.

Other options on the menu include using “low-emissions fuels,” “transitional fuels,” and “low-emissions technologies,” ranging from renewables to CCUS.

It also specifies the adaptation cycle and embraces the various ways countries communicate their adaptation plans and needs.

In 2023 the mitigation work programme (MWP) focused on energy transitions, invoking similar divides as in the GST’s energy transition negotiations. Discussions did not result in substantive outcomes, largely because negotiators still cannot agree on the MWP’s mandate. Developed countries pushed to re-position the MWP as a platform to take forward the GST’s outcomes. Others rejected this as beyond the programme’s mandate and modalities. The call to build on the GST is absent from the procedural MWP outcome. In a sign of procedural debates to come, the GST decision invites “relevant work programmes” to integrate the GST’s outcomes into their future work."

A contact group will oversee and discuss the dialogues, and reports will inform the next GST.

Particularly since the COVID pandemic, developing countries have had little fiscal space, and climate finance loans, on which interest has to be paid, would push them beyond their available borrowing space.

Developing countries worry this discussion is a ruse to shift developed countries’ responsibility for providing climate finance to other entities. In the compromise to balance all countries’ suggested finance topics, Article 2.1(c) was discussed under the SCF rather than as a stand-alone item. The GST helped get Article 2.1(c) on its feet, deciding to continue and strengthen the dialogue, while also ensuring the discussions on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance shift to negotiation mode.

The sources of the problem—fossil fuels—still have ample footing to fight for survival.

In turn, 2025, which is when countries are supposed to submit their more ambitious, hopefully 1.5°C aligned, NDCs, will show whether the fundamental idea of the Paris Agreement’s ratchet up mechanism allows the creature to walk into the future with its head held high.
